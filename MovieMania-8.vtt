00:06.000 --> 00:11.000
So, finally, we have one last thing left which is Real-time Movie Search.

00:11.000 --> 00:18.000
So, what was happening here is that when you were clicking on the search button, the movie was showing up.

00:18.000 --> 00:20.000
But what are we going to do now?

00:20.000 --> 00:22.000
We are going to search in real-time.

00:22.000 --> 00:27.000
That means, as you keep searching, the movies will keep showing up.

00:27.000 --> 00:29.000
How will that happen?

00:29.000 --> 00:32.000
Here, we will be using React UseEffect.

00:32.000 --> 00:34.000
What is UseEffect?

00:34.000 --> 00:37.000
Basically, what is UseEffect?

00:37.000 --> 00:41.000
Whenever your page gets loaded, when you use UseEffect,

00:41.000 --> 00:47.000
whenever you load a page or according to some parameters,

00:47.000 --> 00:52.000
you can run a particular function or a particular thing.

00:52.000 --> 00:55.000
That means, let me show you.

00:55.000 --> 00:59.000
To use UseEffect, first of all, you have to import it on top.

00:59.000 --> 01:04.000
So, you will do useEffect, comma, slash useEffect.

01:04.000 --> 01:06.000
So, it will automatically import.

01:06.000 --> 01:10.000
To use it, its syntax is of this type.

01:10.000 --> 01:12.000
So, we go down here.

01:12.000 --> 01:14.000
Now, before that, let me tell you one more thing.

01:14.000 --> 01:18.000
All the things related to JSX are written in return.

01:18.000 --> 01:23.000
All the variables and functions that are created on it are created on top of it.

01:23.000 --> 01:25.000
So, you have to keep this in mind.

01:25.000 --> 01:27.000
So, what is UseEffect?

01:27.000 --> 01:30.000
You do something like this.

01:30.000 --> 01:33.000
After that, you create an arrow function inside it.

01:33.000 --> 01:35.000
Callback function, basically.

01:35.000 --> 01:38.000
And whatever you write inside it,

01:38.000 --> 01:42.000
it will run whenever your page gets loaded

01:42.000 --> 01:45.000
or whenever you want it to run.

01:45.000 --> 01:50.000
That means, we want that whenever a user writes something in search,

01:50.000 --> 01:51.000
in the search box,

01:51.000 --> 01:53.000
whenever the search runs,

01:53.000 --> 01:56.000
then only this function of search movies will run.

01:56.000 --> 01:59.000
That means, for example, user is writing Avengers.

01:59.000 --> 02:02.000
So, not after pressing the search button,

02:02.000 --> 02:05.000
the movie should be seen at the same time.

02:05.000 --> 02:07.000
So, what we will put here?

02:07.000 --> 02:10.000
We will put the function of search movies.

02:10.000 --> 02:13.000
And we will say that here is the search term.

02:13.000 --> 02:14.000
This is basic.

02:14.000 --> 02:16.000
You know that what will the movie search?

02:16.000 --> 02:17.000
What will go in the movie function?

02:17.000 --> 02:20.000
The search term will go and the movie will be searched there.

02:20.000 --> 02:23.000
But the special thing here is that

02:23.000 --> 02:25.000
when your page gets loaded,

02:25.000 --> 02:27.000
when your page gets loaded for now,

02:27.000 --> 02:32.000
then whatever is inside the search term will be searched.

02:32.000 --> 02:35.000
That means, Avengers is inside the search term by default.

02:35.000 --> 02:37.000
So, you will get this as a search value.

02:37.000 --> 02:39.000
See, I will show you.

02:39.000 --> 02:41.000
Now, you will go to Chrome.

02:41.000 --> 02:43.000
So, you will see Avengers.

02:43.000 --> 02:46.000
Here, you will be able to see Avengers' data below.

02:46.000 --> 02:48.000
You can see Avengers.

02:48.000 --> 02:51.000
You did not search Avengers, but you can still see it.

02:51.000 --> 02:54.000
Here, in default, you have the Avengers value.

02:54.000 --> 02:56.000
You set that.

02:56.000 --> 02:58.000
Wait a minute.

02:58.000 --> 03:02.000
You set the Avengers value in default.

03:02.000 --> 03:05.000
If you are not using the use effect,

03:05.000 --> 03:11.000
then you do not see it even after setting the Avengers value.

03:11.000 --> 03:12.000
That is why you do not see it.

03:12.000 --> 03:15.000
Because the search term has not been called yet.

03:15.000 --> 03:17.000
But as soon as you used the use effect,

03:17.000 --> 03:18.000
as soon as the page got loaded,

03:18.000 --> 03:20.000
it immediately called the function of search movies.

03:20.000 --> 03:23.000
And the search term was visible to you.

03:23.000 --> 03:26.000
But we want that when the user starts searching something,

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
then the search movies are visible to him.

03:28.000 --> 03:31.000
So, here we pass a dependency array.

03:31.000 --> 03:33.000
What is a dependency array?

03:33.000 --> 03:35.000
Whatever you will put in it,

03:35.000 --> 03:36.000
by putting a comma,

03:36.000 --> 03:38.000
whenever there will be changes in that thing,

03:38.000 --> 03:41.000
then only your function use effect will work.

03:41.000 --> 03:43.000
For example, we put the search term here.

03:43.000 --> 03:46.000
So, whenever we will keep doing changes in the search term,

03:46.000 --> 03:48.000
the user will keep searching.

03:48.000 --> 03:51.000
The data of the movie will keep changing again and again.

03:51.000 --> 03:52.000
So, now we go to Chrome.

03:52.000 --> 03:55.000
And now here once,

03:55.000 --> 03:58.000
we try to do something.

03:58.000 --> 04:01.000
For example, we do iron man here.

04:01.000 --> 04:02.000
So, see this.

04:02.000 --> 04:03.000
We did not click the search button,

04:03.000 --> 04:05.000
even after that it was searched.

04:05.000 --> 04:07.000
So, this is real-time search.

04:07.000 --> 04:10.000
We implemented using the use effect.

04:10.000 --> 04:13.000
So, finally our project is completed.

04:13.000 --> 04:17.000
You will mention it in your resume anywhere.

04:17.000 --> 04:19.000
And remember one more thing here,

04:19.000 --> 04:22.000
that you can modify it according to you.

04:22.000 --> 04:25.000
This is a basic idea you have taken.

04:25.000 --> 04:27.000
You can modify it according to you

04:27.000 --> 04:29.000
and take it to the next level.

04:29.000 --> 04:32.000
So, for now this project is completed.
