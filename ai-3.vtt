00:06.000 --> 00:12.000
So now let's see how we can take messages from one script to another script.

00:12.000 --> 00:19.000
For example, here we have scraped content of the website, text content.

00:19.000 --> 00:24.000
Now if we want this scraped content to be analyzed,

00:24.000 --> 00:27.000
we can give that to chat GPT API.

00:27.000 --> 00:30.000
So we want to do this task in the background.

00:30.000 --> 00:34.000
Because here we are calling our API,

00:34.000 --> 00:37.000
then sending data from API, then receiving.

00:37.000 --> 00:41.000
So this work will be done in the background only then it will be better.

00:41.000 --> 00:45.000
And it happens that such works happen in the background.

00:45.000 --> 00:50.000
So for this we have to transfer our scraped content to the background script.

00:50.000 --> 00:52.000
So what will we do for that?

00:52.000 --> 00:54.000
So now you can see that our background script

00:54.000 --> 00:57.000
is background.ts.

00:57.000 --> 01:01.000
If we want to transfer this scraped content to this script,

01:01.000 --> 01:02.000
then what will we do?

01:02.000 --> 01:06.000
We have a method to send message from here.

01:06.000 --> 01:09.000
It is called chrome.runtime.sendMessage.

01:09.000 --> 01:15.000
By using this, we can transfer a message from one place to another in any script.

01:15.000 --> 01:17.000
So there goes this method.

01:17.000 --> 01:19.000
In which what you do is,

01:19.000 --> 01:21.000
first you put an object.

01:21.000 --> 01:23.000
First you write chrome.runtime.sendMessage.

01:23.000 --> 01:25.000
In that, an object goes.

01:25.000 --> 01:29.000
In which you can put any name of an object.

01:29.000 --> 01:32.000
For example, you can call a trimmed text as a scraped text.

01:32.000 --> 01:35.000
And you give it the value of a scrimmed text.

01:35.000 --> 01:39.000
So if you want to access this scrimmed text from anywhere,

01:39.000 --> 01:41.000
then you can access it as a scraped text.

01:41.000 --> 01:44.000
So let me tell you this well.

01:44.000 --> 01:47.000
What happened is that this message has spread out everywhere.

01:47.000 --> 01:50.000
Now you can receive this message from any file.

01:50.000 --> 01:52.000
You just have to use a method.

01:52.000 --> 01:56.000
Which is the method of chrome.runtime.sendMessage.

01:56.000 --> 01:58.000
As soon as you use that method,

01:58.000 --> 02:00.000
you will be able to receive it from anywhere.

02:00.000 --> 02:05.000
So this scrimmed text which is also our content,

02:05.000 --> 02:07.000
has gone inside the scraped text.

02:07.000 --> 02:10.000
And as soon as you directly access the scraped text,

02:10.000 --> 02:12.000
this scrimmed text will automatically come to you.

02:12.000 --> 02:14.000
So first we save it.

02:14.000 --> 02:16.000
Let's go to the background.

02:16.000 --> 02:18.000
Let's paste it.

02:18.000 --> 02:21.000
And our function is something like this.

02:22.000 --> 02:24.000
So this function is something like this,

02:24.000 --> 02:26.000
which you use to receive a message.

02:26.000 --> 02:28.000
Now here you write the first thing, if

02:28.000 --> 02:32.000
message.scraped

02:32.000 --> 02:35.000
Here I have turned on my caps lock.

02:35.000 --> 02:38.000
So let me do it in small letters first.

02:38.000 --> 02:42.000
message.scrapedText

02:42.000 --> 02:44.000
Now I will explain to you what this is and what I am doing.

02:44.000 --> 02:47.000
So what I have done here is,

02:47.000 --> 02:49.000
and once console.log

02:49.000 --> 02:51.000
message.scrapedText

02:52.000 --> 02:56.000
Now let's see what I have done here.

02:56.000 --> 02:58.000
First of all,

02:58.000 --> 03:00.000
from the popup,

03:00.000 --> 03:04.000
we have sent our message with the scraped text in every file.

03:04.000 --> 03:06.000
It has been sent everywhere.

03:06.000 --> 03:09.000
Then we have received it from the background.

03:09.000 --> 03:13.000
We have used the method of chrome.runtime.onMessage.

03:13.000 --> 03:15.000
We have put a message parameter in it.

03:15.000 --> 03:18.000
So whatever message will come from here,

03:18.000 --> 03:21.000
will be saved in the message parameter.

03:21.000 --> 03:26.000
And then we can access the message from it.

03:26.000 --> 03:29.000
So the scraped text was saved in the message.

03:29.000 --> 03:32.000
We have accessed it by doing message.scrapedText

03:32.000 --> 03:34.000
and it has been accessed.

03:34.000 --> 03:36.000
So you can access it in this way.

03:36.000 --> 03:38.000
We have accessed it in the background.

03:38.000 --> 03:40.000
So now whenever the text will be scraped,

03:40.000 --> 03:42.000
it will come directly in the background

03:42.000 --> 03:45.000
and it will be printed in the background.

03:45.000 --> 03:47.000
It will be logged in the console.

03:47.000 --> 03:49.000
Right now we are logging it.

03:49.000 --> 03:51.000
What we will do tomorrow is,

03:51.000 --> 03:53.000
we will do analysis,

03:53.000 --> 03:54.000
we will summarize,

03:54.000 --> 03:56.000
we will use openAI here.

03:56.000 --> 03:57.000
So for now,

03:57.000 --> 04:00.000
I will show you whether it is printing or not.

04:00.000 --> 04:01.000
So for that,

04:01.000 --> 04:02.000
first of all,

04:02.000 --> 04:03.000
you go to chrome.

04:03.000 --> 04:05.000
After going to chrome,

04:05.000 --> 04:07.000
the first thing you have to do is,

04:07.000 --> 04:09.000
you have to go to extension,

04:09.000 --> 04:11.000
chrome slash extensions.

04:11.000 --> 04:13.000
And you have to reload it.

04:13.000 --> 04:14.000
Because,

04:14.000 --> 04:17.000
whenever you do changes in background.ts,

04:17.000 --> 04:19.000
or content.js,

04:19.000 --> 04:20.000
or in ts,

04:20.000 --> 04:24.000
then you have to reload the extension every time.

04:24.000 --> 04:26.000
So what you have to do here is,

04:26.000 --> 04:29.000
you go back to the artificial intelligence wikipedia.

04:29.000 --> 04:31.000
And your extension,

04:31.000 --> 04:33.000
I had un-pinned it.

04:33.000 --> 04:35.000
I will pin it back.

04:35.000 --> 04:37.000
We have opened the extension.

04:37.000 --> 04:39.000
And this time we will click on hello world.

04:39.000 --> 04:41.000
So when we used to click earlier,

04:41.000 --> 04:42.000
you might remember,

04:42.000 --> 04:43.000
after scraping,

04:43.000 --> 04:44.000
alert used to show.

04:44.000 --> 04:45.000
But now it won't.

04:45.000 --> 04:47.000
As soon as you clicked on hello world,

04:47.000 --> 04:48.000
the message has been transferred

04:48.000 --> 04:49.000
to the background script.

04:49.000 --> 04:50.000
And the background script

04:50.000 --> 04:52.000
has printed that thing in the console.

04:52.000 --> 04:53.000
So now you can see,

04:53.000 --> 04:55.000
the message we have,

04:55.000 --> 04:56.000
has come completely.

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
Whatever was written in the web page,

04:58.000 --> 04:59.000
everything has come.

04:59.000 --> 05:01.000
If you click on show more,

05:01.000 --> 05:03.000
then the whole content of the web page,

05:03.000 --> 05:06.000
has come to us.

05:06.000 --> 05:09.000
So now you can see,

05:09.000 --> 05:12.000
how easy it was to send the message.

05:12.000 --> 05:13.000
Now here,

05:13.000 --> 05:15.000
in the whole backend,

05:15.000 --> 05:16.000
you can see background.ts.

05:16.000 --> 05:17.000
Like here,

05:17.000 --> 05:18.000
by selecting background.js,

05:18.000 --> 05:20.000
I will click on hello world.

05:20.000 --> 05:21.000
And when I go back,

05:21.000 --> 05:22.000
you can see,

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
you get all the text.

05:24.000 --> 05:25.000
So here you can understand,

05:25.000 --> 05:26.000
tomorrow,

05:26.000 --> 05:27.000
we will keep our analyzed text,

05:27.000 --> 05:28.000
summarized text.

05:28.000 --> 05:29.000
And in the same way,

05:29.000 --> 05:30.000
we will send the text,

05:30.000 --> 05:31.000
which will be analyzed,

05:31.000 --> 05:32.000
which will be summarized,

05:32.000 --> 05:33.000
to the message,

05:33.000 --> 05:34.000
in the popup.

05:34.000 --> 05:35.000
So here,

05:35.000 --> 05:36.000
it will be analyzed.

05:36.000 --> 05:37.000
Then the message will be sent

05:37.000 --> 05:38.000
to the popup.

05:38.000 --> 05:39.000
Then your result will be shown here.

05:39.000 --> 05:40.000
So now,

05:40.000 --> 05:41.000
you can see,

05:41.000 --> 05:42.000
that the text,

05:42.000 --> 05:43.000
which was analyzed,

05:43.000 --> 05:44.000
will be sent to the popup.

05:44.000 --> 05:45.000
So here,

05:45.000 --> 05:46.000
the text,

05:46.000 --> 05:47.000
will be sent to the popup.

05:47.000 --> 05:48.000
And here,

05:48.000 --> 05:49.000
the result will be shown.

05:49.000 --> 05:50.000
So,

05:50.000 --> 05:51.000
I hope,

05:51.000 --> 05:52.000
you understood,

05:52.000 --> 05:53.000
how to send a message.

05:53.000 --> 05:54.000
And what is the need for it.
