WEBVTT

00:06.000 --> 00:13.000
So now to add Google Authentication, first of all we will do one thing that we will clear all these things before app.js.

00:13.000 --> 00:18.000
So we will go to app.js and these are some things that we remove.

00:18.000 --> 00:25.000
Now after this, here are some things imported like app.css and these things which are not necessary, we remove them too.

00:25.000 --> 00:28.000
And this is already a state, we remove it too.

00:28.000 --> 00:30.000
Okay.

00:30.000 --> 00:35.000
Now here you have to install one thing which is react-router-dom.

00:35.000 --> 00:38.000
Now what is react-router basically?

00:38.000 --> 00:40.000
So what is react-router?

00:40.000 --> 00:47.000
Suppose for some reason we go to our web page and our web page is like this.

00:47.000 --> 00:52.000
For example localhost or 127 and colon 5173.

00:52.000 --> 00:56.000
So this is basically the URL of our website.

00:56.000 --> 00:58.000
Now any user will come.

00:58.000 --> 01:00.000
So if we want to send it to our login page.

01:00.000 --> 01:05.000
So you must have seen in websites that if someone goes to the login page, then he comes after logging in.

01:05.000 --> 01:07.000
So he comes to the login page.

01:07.000 --> 01:13.000
And otherwise if someone goes to the form page for example, then he will come after forward slash.

01:13.000 --> 01:15.000
So he will go to the form page.

01:15.000 --> 01:17.000
Someone has to search for someone's portfolio.

01:17.000 --> 01:21.000
So he will write slash and write John.

01:21.000 --> 01:26.000
So if he writes like this, then he should see the portfolio of a person named John Doe.

01:26.000 --> 01:29.000
So here the route, the changes that are happening, the routes.

01:29.000 --> 01:31.000
You must be able to understand the meaning of route.

01:31.000 --> 01:33.000
Path. Basically the different paths.

01:33.000 --> 01:37.000
How do we decide that when someone goes here, then something like this should open.

01:37.000 --> 01:40.000
When someone goes to login, then the login page should be visible.

01:40.000 --> 01:46.000
When someone goes to John Doe slash about, then the user's about page should come.

01:46.000 --> 01:48.000
We have to check these things.

01:48.000 --> 01:49.000
How will we do this?

01:49.000 --> 01:51.000
We will check with the help of react-router-dom.

01:51.000 --> 01:53.000
So what do we do for this?

01:53.000 --> 01:55.000
First of all, we will go to our terminal.

01:56.000 --> 01:59.000
And we will go to our command prompt.

01:59.000 --> 02:02.000
So this is our command prompt.

02:02.000 --> 02:05.000
We will stop the server for a while.

02:05.000 --> 02:07.000
Or it is better to stop the server again and again.

02:07.000 --> 02:10.000
Let's open a new window in it.

02:10.000 --> 02:12.000
And we go to this.

02:12.000 --> 02:17.000
Cd space desktop slash portfolio builder.

02:17.000 --> 02:20.000
And here we go and install.

02:20.000 --> 02:23.000
So npm install.

02:23.000 --> 02:25.000
Then you will click react-router-dom.

02:25.000 --> 02:31.000
And if we enter, then this utility package will be installed.

02:31.000 --> 02:33.000
We will clear this.

02:33.000 --> 02:36.000
And after that we will go to our VS code.

02:36.000 --> 02:38.000
So we have come to our VS code.

02:38.000 --> 02:41.000
And now what you have to do is you have to import it.

02:41.000 --> 02:43.000
So what will you write to import?

02:43.000 --> 02:46.000
To import, you have to write here.

02:46.000 --> 02:47.000
Yes, yes.

02:47.000 --> 02:51.000
Import routes from react-router-dom.

02:51.000 --> 02:53.000
Now what is this?

02:53.000 --> 02:54.000
See.

02:54.000 --> 03:00.000
So you define your routes in this component named routes.

03:00.000 --> 03:02.000
You will understand this thing now.

03:02.000 --> 03:04.000
Before that, we do one more thing.

03:04.000 --> 03:07.000
We go to our main.jsx.

03:07.000 --> 03:11.000
And after going to main.jsx,

03:11.000 --> 03:15.000
here we have some things that we have to import here.

03:15.000 --> 03:17.000
Like here you have to import by doing react-dom.

03:17.000 --> 03:19.000
It is already imported.

03:19.000 --> 03:21.000
After this, you have to write router here.

03:21.000 --> 03:23.000
You will write router on the app.

03:24.000 --> 03:28.000
And before that, I will select it here as jsx.

03:28.000 --> 03:30.000
Okay.

03:30.000 --> 03:32.000
By doing router.

03:32.000 --> 03:36.000
And here we will cut it and put it below it.

03:38.000 --> 03:41.000
And we will do something like this on router and import it.

03:41.000 --> 03:42.000
How did I import?

03:42.000 --> 03:43.000
I selected router.

03:43.000 --> 03:46.000
I pressed control and space.

03:46.000 --> 03:47.000
And then I hit enter.

03:47.000 --> 03:48.000
So it was imported.

03:48.000 --> 03:49.000
Okay.

03:49.000 --> 03:52.000
So whatever things are there in the router,

03:52.000 --> 03:55.000
we can use our react-router-dom in it.

03:55.000 --> 03:58.000
So this thing is necessary to use react-router-dom.

03:58.000 --> 04:00.000
So we have put it outside the app.

04:00.000 --> 04:04.000
That is, we can use the router-dom in the app.

04:04.000 --> 04:05.000
Okay.

04:05.000 --> 04:07.000
So what do we do now?

04:07.000 --> 04:09.000
Now let's go to our app.jsx.

04:09.000 --> 04:12.000
And in app.jsx, our things,

04:12.000 --> 04:17.000
that is, the things that we have imported by doing routes and routes,

04:17.000 --> 04:19.000
we will now use it here.

04:19.000 --> 04:20.000
So now let's come here.

04:20.000 --> 04:22.000
And first of all,

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000
here we will write routes.

04:24.000 --> 04:25.000
Routes.

04:25.000 --> 04:26.000
Hit enter.

04:26.000 --> 04:28.000
And in these routes,

04:28.000 --> 04:30.000
we will write different routes.

04:30.000 --> 04:31.000
For example,

04:31.000 --> 04:32.000
if we write

04:36.000 --> 04:37.000
route.

04:37.000 --> 04:38.000
And after that,

04:38.000 --> 04:40.000
this is our,

04:40.000 --> 04:41.000
basically our component.

04:41.000 --> 04:42.000
So it is self-closing.

04:42.000 --> 04:44.000
So we remove it.

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
And do something like this.

04:46.000 --> 04:47.000
Okay.

04:47.000 --> 04:49.000
Now here you will write first,

04:49.000 --> 04:50.000
path.

04:50.000 --> 04:53.000
Now you will write path forward slash.

04:53.000 --> 04:54.000
Then after that,

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
you will go here and write element.

04:56.000 --> 04:59.000
And here you will put any element.

04:59.000 --> 05:00.000
For example,

05:00.000 --> 05:02.000
here we make an element.

05:02.000 --> 05:05.000
Element is basically a component.

05:05.000 --> 05:07.000
So let's do one thing in the souls folder.

05:07.000 --> 05:09.000
Let's make another folder of our component.

05:09.000 --> 05:12.000
Component.

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
By doing components.

05:14.000 --> 05:16.000
And in this component,

05:16.000 --> 05:17.000
let's do one thing.

05:17.000 --> 05:18.000
Here we make our,

05:18.000 --> 05:20.000
here we put our,

05:20.000 --> 05:23.000
assets also in this component.

05:23.000 --> 05:24.000
And after that,

05:24.000 --> 05:26.000
what we do is that,

05:26.000 --> 05:27.000
what we make in our component.

05:27.000 --> 05:29.000
What we make in the component is that,

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
we start making files in the component.

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
Like what will be our files in the component.

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
One will be main.jsx.

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
In which we can show our form.

05:38.000 --> 05:39.000
Portfolio form.

05:39.000 --> 05:40.000
Right.

05:40.000 --> 05:41.000
After that,

05:41.000 --> 05:42.000
one will be login.jsx.

05:42.000 --> 05:43.000
In which our,

05:43.000 --> 05:44.000
which is,

05:44.000 --> 05:46.000
login page basically.

05:46.000 --> 05:47.000
We will be able to show that.

05:48.000 --> 05:49.000
After that,

05:49.000 --> 05:51.000
we create another component.

05:51.000 --> 05:53.000
Which we name it.

05:53.000 --> 05:55.000
About.jsx.

05:55.000 --> 05:56.000
So in this,

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
we will be able to show the about of the user.

05:58.000 --> 06:00.000
We create a different component.

06:00.000 --> 06:01.000
Which we name it.

06:01.000 --> 06:03.000
Our contact.jsx.

06:06.000 --> 06:08.000
And after that,

06:08.000 --> 06:09.000
for now,

06:09.000 --> 06:11.000
we create the same components.

06:11.000 --> 06:13.000
Go to main.jsx.

06:13.000 --> 06:14.000
Write rafc.

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
And here the shortcut component is prepared.

06:16.000 --> 06:17.000
Here we write.

06:17.000 --> 06:18.000
This is,

06:18.000 --> 06:19.000
main.

06:21.000 --> 06:22.000
Okay.

06:22.000 --> 06:23.000
Now what will we do?

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
Here we will write as main.

06:25.000 --> 06:27.000
For the main component.

06:28.000 --> 06:29.000
Okay.

06:29.000 --> 06:30.000
Then what did I do here?

06:30.000 --> 06:33.000
Once we understand it properly.

06:33.000 --> 06:34.000
What did I do?

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
That we used react-router-dom here.

06:37.000 --> 06:39.000
Now what does react-router-dom do?

06:39.000 --> 06:41.000
I have told you that it decides the path.

06:41.000 --> 06:43.000
Where what will be shown.

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
So in app.js,

06:45.000 --> 06:46.000
first we went to main.js.

06:46.000 --> 06:47.000
And there we have configured it.

06:47.000 --> 06:49.000
We have configured it by doing router-router.

06:49.000 --> 06:51.000
Here we have written router.

06:51.000 --> 06:53.000
So now the app is configured.

06:53.000 --> 06:55.000
Now we can use router-dom in it.

06:55.000 --> 06:57.000
We can use the routes.

06:57.000 --> 06:59.000
Now we went to our app.js.

06:59.000 --> 07:02.000
And we have put a tag here by doing routes.

07:02.000 --> 07:03.000
In between that,

07:03.000 --> 07:05.000
we have put the route.

07:05.000 --> 07:06.000
Now what do we do?

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
Whatever things are there in the routes,

07:08.000 --> 07:09.000
they decide the path.

07:09.000 --> 07:10.000
For example,

07:10.000 --> 07:12.000
you wrote forward slash.

07:12.000 --> 07:13.000
So what will forward slash do?

07:13.000 --> 07:15.000
As soon as any user goes to forward slash,

07:15.000 --> 07:16.000
of the site.

07:16.000 --> 07:17.000
Suppose,

07:17.000 --> 07:18.000
any user goes forward slash.

07:18.000 --> 07:19.000
Means,

07:19.000 --> 07:20.000
as soon as the site opens,

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
he will see the main page rendered first.

07:22.000 --> 07:23.000
Okay.

07:23.000 --> 07:24.000
And for example,

07:24.000 --> 07:26.000
as soon as any user goes to login,

07:26.000 --> 07:28.000
slash login,

07:28.000 --> 07:30.000
he will see the login page rendered.

07:30.000 --> 07:31.000
So that means,

07:31.000 --> 07:32.000
you decide here,

07:32.000 --> 07:33.000
where what things should be seen.

07:33.000 --> 07:34.000
So for example,

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
we add one thing to our login page,

07:36.000 --> 07:37.000
by doing rafc.

07:37.000 --> 07:39.000
And here we write,

07:39.000 --> 07:42.000
this is login page.

07:43.000 --> 07:44.000
After this,

07:44.000 --> 07:45.000
we have to do one more thing.

07:45.000 --> 07:46.000
That is,

07:46.000 --> 07:48.000
we go to our main.jsx.

07:48.000 --> 07:49.000
And here,

07:49.000 --> 07:52.000
we had imported the router by mistake.

07:52.000 --> 07:53.000
So,

07:53.000 --> 07:54.000
what happens is,

07:54.000 --> 07:55.000
it gives you an error.

07:55.000 --> 07:56.000
Means,

07:56.000 --> 07:57.000
if you go to your path,

07:57.000 --> 07:58.000
slash login,

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
then you don't get that path.

08:00.000 --> 08:01.000
So,

08:01.000 --> 08:02.000
you have to import something like this.

08:02.000 --> 08:03.000
So,

08:03.000 --> 08:04.000
that router,

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
you have to import it directly like a router.

08:06.000 --> 08:07.000
Browser router,

08:07.000 --> 08:08.000
has to be imported as a router.

08:08.000 --> 08:09.000
Okay.

08:09.000 --> 08:10.000
So,

08:10.000 --> 08:11.000
what happens is,

08:11.000 --> 08:12.000
your router gets imported.

08:12.000 --> 08:13.000
Now,

08:13.000 --> 08:14.000
what do we do?

08:14.000 --> 08:15.000
Let's see,

08:15.000 --> 08:16.000
whether our path is working or not.

08:16.000 --> 08:17.000
So,

08:17.000 --> 08:18.000
first,

08:18.000 --> 08:19.000
we imported here.

08:19.000 --> 08:20.000
After importing,

08:20.000 --> 08:21.000
what did we do?

08:21.000 --> 08:22.000
We went to our app.js.

08:22.000 --> 08:23.000
And after going to this,

08:23.000 --> 08:25.000
we used our component named routes.

08:25.000 --> 08:26.000
In that,

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
we rendered these two routes.

08:28.000 --> 08:29.000
Means,

08:29.000 --> 08:30.000
if someone goes to forward slash,

08:30.000 --> 08:31.000
then he sees this page.

08:31.000 --> 08:32.000
If someone goes to slash login,

08:32.000 --> 08:34.000
then he sees this page.

08:34.000 --> 08:35.000
Now,

08:35.000 --> 08:36.000
we go to our website.

08:36.000 --> 08:37.000
So,

08:37.000 --> 08:38.000
we open our chrome.

08:38.000 --> 08:39.000
And see,

08:39.000 --> 08:40.000
as soon as I opened chrome,

08:40.000 --> 08:42.000
as soon as the user came to forward slash,

08:42.000 --> 08:43.000
means,

08:43.000 --> 08:45.000
the default URL is forward slash.

08:45.000 --> 08:46.000
So,

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
as soon as the user came to the main page,

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
this thing came to the main page.

08:50.000 --> 08:51.000
So,

08:51.000 --> 08:53.000
as soon as the user goes to login,

08:53.000 --> 08:54.000
see,

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
this thing came to the login page.

08:56.000 --> 08:57.000
So,

08:57.000 --> 08:58.000
how did this happen?

08:58.000 --> 08:59.000
The router we made,

08:59.000 --> 09:00.000
the routes we made,

09:00.000 --> 09:01.000
because of that,

09:01.000 --> 09:03.000
this thing happened.

09:03.000 --> 09:04.000
So,

09:04.000 --> 09:05.000
I hope you understood this thing,

09:05.000 --> 09:06.000
how it happened.

09:06.000 --> 09:07.000
And,

09:07.000 --> 09:08.000
even if it is not clear,

09:08.000 --> 09:09.000
there is no need to worry.

09:09.000 --> 09:10.000
Because,

09:10.000 --> 09:11.000
as we progress,

09:11.000 --> 09:12.000
everything will be clear to you.

09:12.000 --> 09:13.000
One by one,

09:13.000 --> 09:15.000
everything will be clear to you.
