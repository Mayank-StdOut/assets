WEBVTT

00:06.000 --> 00:12.000
To set up Google login, we will first install a package which is Google OAuth Provider.

00:12.000 --> 00:28.000
To install the package, go to your terminal and enter the command npm install react-oauth-google

00:28.000 --> 00:34.000
After this, go to your VS Code and go to your main.jsx.

00:34.000 --> 00:37.000
First of all, we will import the package.

00:37.000 --> 00:41.000
import google-oauth-provider

00:41.000 --> 00:47.000
After this, we will use Google OAuth Provider at the top.

00:47.000 --> 00:53.000
After this, we will use Google OAuth Provider at the top.

00:53.000 --> 00:57.000
Now open and close both the stack.

00:57.000 --> 00:58.000
Now open and close both the stack.

00:58.000 --> 01:00.000
Now I will put the package as is.

01:00.000 --> 01:03.000
Now Google OAuth provider is covering you.

01:03.000 --> 01:09.000
Now while importing you will find it using this application

01:09.000 --> 01:13.000
Next we will go to our login page.

01:13.000 --> 01:20.000
Now now what we should do is

01:20.000 --> 01:27.000
Means, we have Google Luna Logon and Google OAuth Provider's package.

01:27.000 --> 01:29.000
so we will import it in this way

01:29.000 --> 01:31.000
so what google login does

01:31.000 --> 01:33.000
it makes the button of google login

01:33.000 --> 01:35.000
for you

01:35.000 --> 01:37.000
so as you use this thing

01:37.000 --> 01:39.000
your google login button gets created

01:39.000 --> 01:41.000
and for this

01:41.000 --> 01:43.000
what we will do is

01:43.000 --> 01:45.000
we have given you a simple code

01:45.000 --> 01:47.000
with which you can directly implement the button

01:47.000 --> 01:49.000
so for this

01:49.000 --> 01:51.000
first I will remove something from it

01:51.000 --> 01:53.000
and here we

01:53.000 --> 01:55.000
put something like this

01:55.000 --> 01:57.000
and here

01:57.000 --> 01:59.000
as soon as you put this code

01:59.000 --> 02:01.000
your google login button will be created

02:01.000 --> 02:03.000
so next time we will check our webpage

02:03.000 --> 02:05.000
we will go to our webpage

02:05.000 --> 02:07.000
so you can see

02:07.000 --> 02:09.000
that google login button is showing here

02:09.000 --> 02:11.000
as soon as you click on google login button

02:11.000 --> 02:13.000
then a popup opens here

02:13.000 --> 02:15.000
this popup opens

02:15.000 --> 02:17.000
but this popup is blank

02:17.000 --> 02:19.000
why is it blank

02:19.000 --> 02:21.000
because in this popup a client id is required

02:21.000 --> 02:23.000
and we have not given that client id

02:23.000 --> 02:25.000
and how to make a client id

02:25.000 --> 02:27.000
we will tell you that

02:27.000 --> 02:29.000
first we will set up our login page

02:29.000 --> 02:31.000
then we will put a client id

02:31.000 --> 02:33.000
and as soon as we put a client id

02:33.000 --> 02:35.000
it will work

02:35.000 --> 02:37.000
so we

02:37.000 --> 02:39.000
go back to vs code

02:39.000 --> 02:41.000
and here first thing

02:41.000 --> 02:43.000
we make a div

02:43.000 --> 02:45.000
div

02:45.000 --> 02:47.000
and we saw that

02:47.000 --> 02:49.000
behind our login page

02:49.000 --> 02:51.000
we put a background image

02:51.000 --> 02:53.000
how we put that background image

02:53.000 --> 02:55.000
for that we have given you a background image

02:55.000 --> 02:57.000
in the link section

02:57.000 --> 02:59.000
so that background image

02:59.000 --> 03:01.000
called bg.jpg

03:01.000 --> 03:03.000
you have to take that

03:03.000 --> 03:05.000
and you have to put that in your assets

03:05.000 --> 03:07.000
so you have to put that in your assets

03:07.000 --> 03:09.000
and after that

03:09.000 --> 03:11.000
logo.png

03:11.000 --> 03:13.000
you have to put that in your assets

03:13.000 --> 03:15.000
and there is one more photo

03:15.000 --> 03:17.000
called profile.jpg

03:17.000 --> 03:19.000
you have to put that in your assets

03:19.000 --> 03:21.000
after downloading

03:21.000 --> 03:23.000
you have to save all these things

03:23.000 --> 03:25.000
in your assets

03:25.000 --> 03:27.000
after that

03:27.000 --> 03:29.000
we go to login

03:29.000 --> 03:31.000
here we have given our class name via bg

03:31.000 --> 03:33.000
after giving bg

03:33.000 --> 03:35.000
we have put brackets here

03:35.000 --> 03:37.000
now what we will do

03:37.000 --> 03:39.000
we will write url

03:39.000 --> 03:41.000
then we will put path

03:41.000 --> 03:43.000
so now what we will do

03:43.000 --> 03:45.000
to add background image

03:45.000 --> 03:47.000
we will use something like this

03:47.000 --> 03:49.000
bg url

03:49.000 --> 03:51.000
so here we will write

03:51.000 --> 03:53.000
slash source slash components

03:53.000 --> 03:55.000
components slash assets

03:55.000 --> 03:57.000
and here we will

03:57.000 --> 03:59.000
do something like this

03:59.000 --> 04:01.000
so what will happen

04:01.000 --> 04:03.000
that our

04:03.000 --> 04:05.000
main div

04:05.000 --> 04:07.000
in that

04:07.000 --> 04:09.000
an image will be added in the background

04:09.000 --> 04:11.000
and we will close the div

04:11.000 --> 04:13.000
by using div

04:13.000 --> 04:15.000
so we have closed it

04:15.000 --> 04:17.000
and our background image has been added

04:17.000 --> 04:19.000
now after this

04:19.000 --> 04:21.000
we have to put bg cover

04:21.000 --> 04:23.000
now if we put bg cover

04:23.000 --> 04:25.000
it will cover the whole page

04:25.000 --> 04:27.000
so what will it do

04:27.000 --> 04:29.000
the image will be in the center of the page

04:29.000 --> 04:31.000
ok

04:31.000 --> 04:33.000
now let's do one thing

04:33.000 --> 04:35.000
let's go to our web page

04:35.000 --> 04:37.000
let's go to our web page

04:37.000 --> 04:39.000
and here

04:39.000 --> 04:41.000
let's see

04:41.000 --> 04:43.000
we can't see the image

04:43.000 --> 04:45.000
so let's check

04:45.000 --> 04:47.000
why we can't see the image

04:47.000 --> 04:49.000
so

04:49.000 --> 04:51.000
let's go back

04:51.000 --> 04:53.000
and let's see

04:53.000 --> 04:55.000
after assets we have to write

04:55.000 --> 04:57.000
slash bg dot

04:57.000 --> 04:59.000
bg dot jpg

04:59.000 --> 05:01.000
right like this

05:01.000 --> 05:03.000
ok now we will go to our browser

05:03.000 --> 05:05.000
and

05:05.000 --> 05:07.000
after going to our browser

05:07.000 --> 05:09.000
when we will see

05:09.000 --> 05:11.000
our image has been loaded

05:11.000 --> 05:13.000
so it is only showing this much

05:13.000 --> 05:15.000
because it is only covering the google login page

05:15.000 --> 05:17.000
now we will put it in the center

05:17.000 --> 05:19.000
so it will cover the entire height

05:19.000 --> 05:21.000
so now we will configure it properly

05:21.000 --> 05:23.000
we will go back

05:23.000 --> 05:25.000
to the vs code

05:25.000 --> 05:27.000
and after going to the vs code

05:27.000 --> 05:29.000
here I will do one more thing

05:29.000 --> 05:31.000
some steps

05:31.000 --> 05:33.000
ok

05:33.000 --> 05:35.000
now what we will do here

05:35.000 --> 05:37.000
we will put an image here

05:37.000 --> 05:39.000
first we will put an image

05:39.000 --> 05:41.000
before the google login button

05:41.000 --> 05:43.000
what will the image do

05:43.000 --> 05:45.000
we will put the icon of our portfolio builder

05:45.000 --> 05:47.000
we will put the icon of our portfolio builder

05:47.000 --> 05:49.000
did we put the image in the source

05:49.000 --> 05:51.000
we put the logo in the source

05:51.000 --> 05:53.000
so we import the logo directly

05:53.000 --> 05:55.000
so we import the logo

05:55.000 --> 05:57.000
import

05:57.000 --> 05:59.000
import

05:59.000 --> 06:01.000
logo from

06:01.000 --> 06:03.000
and dot

06:03.000 --> 06:05.000
forward slash

06:05.000 --> 06:07.000
assets

06:07.000 --> 06:09.000
slash logo dot png

06:09.000 --> 06:11.000
like this

06:11.000 --> 06:13.000
we will import something

06:13.000 --> 06:15.000
and here in the source

06:15.000 --> 06:17.000
we will set the logo

06:17.000 --> 06:19.000
ok

06:19.000 --> 06:21.000
and here we will write

06:21.000 --> 06:23.000
logo

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
ok

06:25.000 --> 06:27.000
and here we will write

06:27.000 --> 06:29.000
logo

06:29.000 --> 06:31.000
ok

06:31.000 --> 06:33.000
ok

06:33.000 --> 06:35.000
ok

06:35.000 --> 06:37.000
ok

06:37.000 --> 06:39.000
ok

06:39.000 --> 06:41.000
ok

06:41.000 --> 06:43.000
ok

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
ok

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
ok

06:47.000 --> 06:49.000
ok

06:49.000 --> 06:51.000
ok

06:51.000 --> 07:07.000
ok

07:07.000 --> 07:09.000
ok

07:09.000 --> 07:11.000
ok

07:11.000 --> 07:13.000
ok

07:13.000 --> 07:15.000
ok

07:15.000 --> 07:17.000
ok

07:17.000 --> 07:19.000
ok

07:19.000 --> 07:22.000
here we will give Z-index 10

07:22.000 --> 07:25.000
so that the background image doesn't go behind the page

07:25.000 --> 07:28.000
and we will give it some brightness

07:28.000 --> 07:31.000
brightness will make it brighter and will make it white

07:31.000 --> 07:34.000
so we will give it some brightness

07:34.000 --> 07:37.000
now after this

07:37.000 --> 07:40.000
we will go to our web page

07:40.000 --> 07:43.000
as you see the web page

07:43.000 --> 07:46.000
it is normal now

07:46.000 --> 07:49.000
it is login with google

07:49.000 --> 07:52.000
and after this

07:52.000 --> 07:55.000
we will add one more thing

07:55.000 --> 07:58.000
we will create a div below this

07:58.000 --> 08:01.000
and the div

08:01.000 --> 08:04.000
we have saved it

08:04.000 --> 08:07.000
we will create a div

08:07.000 --> 08:10.000
and in div we will give a class name

08:10.000 --> 08:13.000
first we will give mxauto

08:13.000 --> 08:16.000
so it will be in the center

08:16.000 --> 08:17.000
hscreen

08:17.000 --> 08:20.000
hscreen covers the entire screen

08:20.000 --> 08:22.000
means the image will be shown in the entire screen

08:22.000 --> 08:23.000
ok

08:23.000 --> 08:25.000
now we will add one more thing

08:25.000 --> 08:28.000
rounded md

08:28.000 --> 08:31.000
so basically

08:31.000 --> 08:34.000
the button will be rounded

08:34.000 --> 08:37.000
after this

08:37.000 --> 08:40.000
the second thing we have to add is flex

08:40.000 --> 08:43.000
and next we have to add justify center

08:43.000 --> 08:45.000
so we have flexed the display

08:45.000 --> 08:47.000
and we have added justify content

08:47.000 --> 08:50.000
so that the content will be in the center

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
of the whole page

08:52.000 --> 08:53.000
and we will enter the item

08:53.000 --> 08:55.000
and the whole content will be in the center

08:55.000 --> 08:58.000
after this we will add backdrop blur

08:58.000 --> 09:00.000
so whatever class you can see

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
I am adding dots here

09:02.000 --> 09:03.000
so what is this

09:03.000 --> 09:06.000
vs code will automatically put it in the class name

09:06.000 --> 09:09.000
ok so this is a shortcut to give

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000
we will do backdrop blur

09:11.000 --> 09:12.000
so what it will do

09:12.000 --> 09:13.000
it will blur the image at the back

09:13.000 --> 09:14.000
what md will do

09:14.000 --> 09:15.000
it will blur a little bit

09:15.000 --> 09:17.000
if you add lg it will blur a little more

09:17.000 --> 09:19.000
if you add xl it will blur more

09:19.000 --> 09:20.000
ok

09:20.000 --> 09:23.000
then the last thing we will give is overflow hidden

09:23.000 --> 09:25.000
so that the page is not scroll

09:25.000 --> 09:27.000
the overflow will be hidden

09:27.000 --> 09:28.000
now we will enter it

09:28.000 --> 09:29.000
so see the div is made

09:29.000 --> 09:31.000
the whole class we added has come

09:31.000 --> 09:32.000
right

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
and this div

09:34.000 --> 09:39.000
we will put this div below the google login div

09:39.000 --> 09:42.000
so the google login will come in this div

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
ok so the google login button will come in the whole page

09:44.000 --> 09:45.000
it will come in the center

09:45.000 --> 09:48.000
and after this the margin auto will come in the middle

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
justify content center is given

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
so now you have understood all these things

09:52.000 --> 09:53.000
right

09:53.000 --> 09:55.000
now as soon as we go to our web page

09:55.000 --> 09:58.000
so as soon as I come to the web page

09:58.000 --> 10:00.000
so here you will see

10:00.000 --> 10:03.000
that this whole thing is ready

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000
like the login page

10:05.000 --> 10:07.000
you can see that it is blurred at the back

10:07.000 --> 10:08.000
right

10:08.000 --> 10:09.000
the whole screen is being covered

10:09.000 --> 10:11.000
and the whole overflow is hidden

10:11.000 --> 10:12.000
so the overflow is not happening here

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
and if you press in google login method

10:14.000 --> 10:15.000
so see this

10:15.000 --> 10:16.000
this popup opens

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
and see the logo above

10:18.000 --> 10:19.000
the one with the portfolio builder

10:19.000 --> 10:21.000
you can see that too

10:21.000 --> 10:22.000
so now what we will do

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
to make it look better

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
we will add a text below it

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
sample text

10:28.000 --> 10:31.000
so now we go to our

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
vs code

10:33.000 --> 10:34.000
and after going here

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
this one sample text

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
it can be something like this

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
here you have seen one more thing

10:40.000 --> 10:41.000
this div

10:41.000 --> 10:42.000
we had put

10:42.000 --> 10:43.000
in which we had put these styles

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
here we have enclosed google login with this

10:45.000 --> 10:46.000
right

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
now after this what we do here

10:48.000 --> 10:50.000
just below this

10:50.000 --> 10:52.000
we put a simple paragraph

10:52.000 --> 10:53.000
in which nothing

10:53.000 --> 10:54.000
you have written

10:54.000 --> 10:56.000
by signing in you agree to this this this

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
this is a placeholder kind of

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
so it will look better

11:00.000 --> 11:01.000
right

11:01.000 --> 11:02.000
after this we do one thing

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
we go to our web page

11:04.000 --> 11:05.000
and we will go

11:05.000 --> 11:07.000
so see this

11:07.000 --> 11:09.000
its look is coming right

11:09.000 --> 11:10.000
we do continue with google

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
so here the continue with google

11:12.000 --> 11:13.000
so sorry

11:13.000 --> 11:17.080
google ghost

11:17.080 --> 11:19.000
wesley

11:19.000 --> 11:20.000
as you can see

11:20.000 --> 11:21.000
its not working

11:21.000 --> 11:22.000
so now

11:22.000 --> 11:23.000
we need a client id

11:23.000 --> 11:24.000
ok

11:24.000 --> 11:25.000
so now what we do

11:25.000 --> 11:26.000
we will go

11:26.000 --> 11:27.000
open a new tab

11:27.000 --> 11:28.000
and write here

11:28.000 --> 11:29.000
google cloud consult

11:29.000 --> 11:31.000
we will get our API profile

11:31.000 --> 11:32.000
application id

11:32.000 --> 11:33.000
client id

11:33.000 --> 11:35.000
which we will put in this

11:35.000 --> 11:36.000
then it will work

11:36.000 --> 11:37.000
so here you will go

11:37.000 --> 11:38.000
and at google

11:38.000 --> 11:39.000
cloud platform

11:39.000 --> 11:41.000
you first sign in

11:41.000 --> 11:44.000
As soon as you sign in, something like this will open.

11:44.000 --> 11:48.000
Look here, a project is being written, portfolio builder, which I had already made.

11:48.000 --> 11:52.000
So I open it and here what we do now is create a new project.

11:52.000 --> 11:55.000
What do you do here? You will go back.

11:55.000 --> 11:57.000
Here you will go to this project at the top.

11:57.000 --> 12:00.000
You must be writing either a new project or something like this.

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
But you must be getting something up there.

12:02.000 --> 12:05.000
You will click here, go to create new project.

12:05.000 --> 12:07.000
And here we give a name to the project.

12:07.000 --> 12:10.000
Okay, we give the name to the project.

12:10.000 --> 12:13.000
Portfolio.

12:13.000 --> 12:16.000
Portfolio site.

12:16.000 --> 12:18.000
Builder.

12:18.000 --> 12:20.000
By doing this, we get some names.

12:20.000 --> 12:24.000
And here who has given the suggestion.

12:24.000 --> 12:28.000
This is not working, so here the suggestions come.

12:28.000 --> 12:31.000
So now we cut it and whatever suggestions are given here.

12:31.000 --> 12:34.000
According to that suggestion, if we go.

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
So something is coming here.

12:36.000 --> 12:37.000
The name has been invalid.

12:37.000 --> 12:38.000
Letters.

12:38.000 --> 12:39.000
Enter letters.

12:39.000 --> 12:40.000
Numbers.

12:40.000 --> 12:41.000
Okay.

12:41.000 --> 12:43.000
Okay, maybe underscore will not work in this.

12:43.000 --> 12:45.000
So portfolio.

12:45.000 --> 12:47.000
Suggestion has come here.

12:47.000 --> 12:49.000
So let's take this suggestion below.

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
By hiding the project.

12:51.000 --> 12:53.000
And we took this suggestion like this.

12:53.000 --> 12:55.000
And here you will click create.

12:55.000 --> 12:56.000
You will click create.

12:56.000 --> 13:01.000
Your project will be created here.

13:01.000 --> 13:03.000
So writing creating project is coming.

13:03.000 --> 13:05.000
Okay, now it's created, right?

13:05.000 --> 13:06.000
Now you will select the project.

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
After selecting, what you have to do?

13:08.000 --> 13:11.000
After selecting, everything will come here.

13:11.000 --> 13:12.000
Project ID etc.

13:12.000 --> 13:14.000
Everything will come here.

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
Now you have to go to the URL.

13:16.000 --> 13:19.000
You have to remove the home app and write everything here.

13:19.000 --> 13:20.000
APIs.

13:20.000 --> 13:21.000
Apis.

13:21.000 --> 13:22.000
Enter.

13:22.000 --> 13:24.000
You will directly reach the APIs section.

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
What will come here as soon as you come here?

13:26.000 --> 13:27.000
Credentials.

13:27.000 --> 13:29.000
First you will go to the credentials.

13:29.000 --> 13:31.000
As soon as you go to the credentials.

13:31.000 --> 13:33.000
You see that the same project is selected.

13:33.000 --> 13:34.000
Which you have just made.

13:34.000 --> 13:35.000
And by going to the credentials.

13:35.000 --> 13:36.000
You will go here.

13:36.000 --> 13:38.000
You will click on create credentials.

13:38.000 --> 13:40.000
You will click on OAuth Client ID.

13:40.000 --> 13:43.000
As soon as you click on OAuth Client ID.

13:43.000 --> 13:46.000
The Client ID will be generated here.

13:46.000 --> 13:49.000
Here you have to click on the Configure Consent Screen.

13:49.000 --> 13:51.000
You will click here.

13:51.000 --> 13:56.000
And here you will reach this page.

13:56.000 --> 13:58.000
Here you have to click on external.

13:58.000 --> 13:59.000
And you have to create.

13:59.000 --> 14:02.000
As soon as you create, it will ask you the information of the app.

14:02.000 --> 14:03.000
So give the name of the app.

14:03.000 --> 14:04.000
So we give the name of the app.

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
Portfolio Builder.

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
And here.

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
User Support Email.

14:10.000 --> 14:13.000
So select the email from which you have created your account.

14:13.000 --> 14:15.000
And here.

14:15.000 --> 14:16.000
If you are asking for a photo.

14:16.000 --> 14:17.000
So don't put that.

14:17.000 --> 14:18.000
No problem.

14:18.000 --> 14:19.000
And here.

14:19.000 --> 14:20.000
Finally.

14:20.000 --> 14:21.000
Developer Contact.

14:21.000 --> 14:25.000
So here you put your email again.

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
gmail.com

14:27.000 --> 14:29.000
Now what you have to do directly from here.

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
Save and continue.

14:31.000 --> 14:32.000
As soon as you do it.

14:32.000 --> 14:33.000
So after this it happens.

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
Second thing comes Scopes.

14:36.000 --> 14:37.000
Right.

14:37.000 --> 14:38.000
Here comes Scopes.

14:38.000 --> 14:39.000
You don't have to do anything.

14:39.000 --> 14:40.000
Save and continue.

14:40.000 --> 14:41.000
And don't do anything.

14:41.000 --> 14:43.000
You have to save and continue everything.

14:43.000 --> 14:46.000
And where.

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
You have to go back to dashboard.

14:48.000 --> 14:49.000
Back to dashboard.

14:49.000 --> 14:50.000
And the work is done.

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
Everything is done.

14:52.000 --> 14:57.000
After this you have to go to your credentials.

14:57.000 --> 14:58.000
After going to credentials.

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
What you have to do here.

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
The OAuth Client ID.

15:02.000 --> 15:03.000
Here you have created.

15:03.000 --> 15:04.000
The account type.

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
You have to select the web application.

15:06.000 --> 15:07.000
Right.

15:07.000 --> 15:08.000
After selecting the web application.

15:08.000 --> 15:09.000
What I did here.

15:09.000 --> 15:10.000
You know.

15:10.000 --> 15:11.000
I came back.

15:11.000 --> 15:12.000
In credentials.

15:12.000 --> 15:13.000
I pressed create again.

15:13.000 --> 15:15.000
Clicked on OAuth Client ID.

15:15.000 --> 15:16.000
Right.

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
Selected its web application.

15:18.000 --> 15:21.000
Here you are asking for authorized origins.

15:21.000 --> 15:22.000
From where.

15:22.000 --> 15:23.000
Which is.

15:23.000 --> 15:26.000
Which site you basically want to implement.

15:26.000 --> 15:27.000
Okay.

15:27.000 --> 15:29.000
So our current site.

15:29.000 --> 15:31.000
Its URL is localhost.

15:31.000 --> 15:32.000
So we are saying.

15:32.000 --> 15:33.000
That it is only localhost.

15:33.000 --> 15:34.000
For now.

15:34.000 --> 15:35.000
Let's keep it for that.

15:35.000 --> 15:37.000
When we will deploy the website.

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
So the URL of our website.

15:39.000 --> 15:40.000
We will put it here.

15:40.000 --> 15:41.000
So this will make it.

15:41.000 --> 15:43.000
Only from the authorized domain.

15:43.000 --> 15:45.000
Google sign in can be done.

15:45.000 --> 15:47.000
So you will do this.

15:47.000 --> 15:50.000
http localhost.

15:50.000 --> 15:52.000
Then we will add another URL.

15:52.000 --> 15:56.000
We will write http.

15:56.000 --> 15:59.000
localhost.

15:59.000 --> 16:00.000
colon.

16:00.000 --> 16:01.000
5173.

16:01.000 --> 16:02.000
Now.

16:02.000 --> 16:03.000
After this.

16:03.000 --> 16:04.000
Okay.

16:04.000 --> 16:05.000
I think.

16:05.000 --> 16:06.000
Here.

16:06.000 --> 16:07.000
Editing.

16:07.000 --> 16:08.000
Yes.

16:08.000 --> 16:09.000
Okay.

16:09.000 --> 16:10.000
So you have to stay in edit.

16:10.000 --> 16:11.000
I had clicked on save from the other side.

16:11.000 --> 16:12.000
After this.

16:12.000 --> 16:13.000
Again.

16:13.000 --> 16:14.000
You have to copy paste the same thing.

16:14.000 --> 16:15.000
Put it down.

16:15.000 --> 16:16.000
Where.

16:16.000 --> 16:17.000
Here.

16:17.000 --> 16:18.000
Add URI.

16:18.000 --> 16:19.000
Okay.

16:19.000 --> 16:20.000
Again.

16:20.000 --> 16:21.000
You have to add a URI.

16:21.000 --> 16:22.000
And.

16:22.000 --> 16:23.000
5.

16:23.000 --> 16:24.000
7.

16:24.000 --> 16:25.000
3.

16:25.000 --> 16:26.000
7.

16:26.000 --> 16:27.000
3.

16:27.000 --> 16:28.000
And you have to add one more thing.

16:28.000 --> 16:29.000
Apart from localhost.

16:29.000 --> 16:30.000
Here.

16:30.000 --> 16:31.000
You have to put.

16:31.000 --> 16:32.000
Here.

16:32.000 --> 16:33.000
You have to put.

16:33.000 --> 16:34.000
127.

16:34.000 --> 16:35.000
Dot.

16:35.000 --> 16:36.000
0.

16:36.000 --> 16:37.000
Dot.

16:37.000 --> 16:38.000
0.

16:38.000 --> 16:39.000
Dot.

16:39.000 --> 16:40.000
1.

16:40.000 --> 16:41.000
Okay.

16:41.000 --> 16:42.000
One minute.

16:42.000 --> 16:43.000
I'm here.

16:43.000 --> 16:44.000
0.

16:44.000 --> 16:45.000
1.

16:45.000 --> 16:46.000
Yes.

16:46.000 --> 16:47.000
So this is our URL.

16:47.000 --> 16:48.000
What you know now.

16:48.000 --> 16:49.000
That our URL.

16:49.000 --> 16:50.000
That's all.

16:50.000 --> 16:51.000
This is gone.

16:51.000 --> 16:52.000
Okay.

16:52.000 --> 16:53.000
After that.

16:53.000 --> 16:54.000
Let's add another URL.

16:54.000 --> 16:55.000
Here.

16:55.000 --> 16:56.000
5.

16:56.000 --> 16:57.000
1.

16:57.000 --> 16:58.000
7.

16:58.000 --> 16:59.000
3.

16:59.000 --> 17:00.000
5.

17:00.000 --> 17:01.000
1.

17:01.000 --> 17:02.000
7.

17:02.000 --> 17:03.000
3.

17:03.000 --> 17:04.000
Let's remove 5.

17:04.000 --> 17:05.000
1.

17:05.000 --> 17:06.000
7.

17:06.000 --> 17:07.000
3.

17:07.000 --> 17:08.000
You have to configure something like this.

17:08.000 --> 17:09.000
If you don't want to put the localhost above.

17:09.000 --> 17:10.000
Then don't put it.

17:10.000 --> 17:11.000
But I put it.

17:11.000 --> 17:12.000
Okay.

17:12.000 --> 17:13.000
After that.

17:13.000 --> 17:14.000
Here.

17:14.000 --> 17:15.000
You configure it.

17:15.000 --> 17:16.000
Here too.

17:16.000 --> 17:17.000
By configuring something like this.

17:17.000 --> 17:18.000
Let's remove this thing.

17:18.000 --> 17:19.000
Right.

17:19.000 --> 17:20.000
Everything is done.

17:20.000 --> 17:21.000
Let's save.

17:21.000 --> 17:22.000
After saving.

17:22.000 --> 17:23.000
We came.

17:23.000 --> 17:24.000
And here.

17:24.000 --> 17:25.000
See.

17:25.000 --> 17:26.000
Your client ID.

17:26.000 --> 17:27.000
This is gone.

17:27.000 --> 17:28.000
Copy it here.

17:28.000 --> 17:29.000
In the key.

17:29.000 --> 17:30.000
This is a formality.

17:30.000 --> 17:31.000
So you just create it.

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
There will be no need for it.

17:33.000 --> 17:34.000
So.

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
Creating API key is happening.

17:36.000 --> 17:37.000
And here it is done.

17:37.000 --> 17:38.000
You close it.

17:38.000 --> 17:39.000
You have copied your client ID.

17:39.000 --> 17:40.000
That's it.

17:40.000 --> 17:41.000
What do you have to do after this?

17:41.000 --> 17:42.000
Now you have to go.

17:42.000 --> 17:43.000
Where?

17:43.000 --> 17:44.000
In the project.

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
So let's go back to our project.

17:46.000 --> 17:47.000
In VSCode.

17:47.000 --> 17:48.000
And in VSCode.

17:48.000 --> 17:52.000
We have the main.jsx.

17:52.000 --> 17:53.000
Main.jsx.

17:53.000 --> 17:54.000
Here we have.

17:54.000 --> 17:56.000
The Google OAuth provider.

17:56.000 --> 17:57.000
Used.

17:57.000 --> 17:58.000
Isn't it?

17:58.000 --> 17:59.000
Google OAuth provider.

17:59.000 --> 18:00.000
Here.

18:00.000 --> 18:01.000
It has a prop.

18:01.000 --> 18:02.000
By doing client ID.

18:02.000 --> 18:03.000
Client ID.

18:03.000 --> 18:05.000
Your client ID will go to this client ID.

18:05.000 --> 18:06.000
So.

18:06.000 --> 18:07.000
As soon as you paste it.

18:07.000 --> 18:08.000
Your client ID.

18:08.000 --> 18:09.000
So it went here.

18:09.000 --> 18:10.000
But.

18:10.000 --> 18:11.000
One thing.

18:11.000 --> 18:12.000
There is more.

18:12.000 --> 18:13.000
Now.

18:13.000 --> 18:14.000
In any real world application.

18:14.000 --> 18:15.000
Directly.

18:15.000 --> 18:16.000
Not in plain text.

18:16.000 --> 18:17.000
No one stores their keys.

18:17.000 --> 18:18.000
Secure things.

18:18.000 --> 18:19.000
Always.

18:19.000 --> 18:20.000
You.

18:20.000 --> 18:21.000
Dot.

18:21.000 --> 18:22.000
Env.

18:22.000 --> 18:23.000
Means.

18:23.000 --> 18:24.000
Stores in a virtual environment.

18:24.000 --> 18:25.000
And then.

18:25.000 --> 18:26.000
Bring that thing here.

18:26.000 --> 18:27.000
Now.

18:27.000 --> 18:28.000
Let me tell you.

18:28.000 --> 18:29.000
So.

18:29.000 --> 18:30.000
What you do.

18:30.000 --> 18:31.000
First of all.

18:31.000 --> 18:32.000
Go to your.

18:32.000 --> 18:33.000
Side.

18:33.000 --> 18:34.000
Here.

18:34.000 --> 18:35.000
In explorer.

18:35.000 --> 18:36.000
In file explorer.

18:36.000 --> 18:37.000
And.

18:37.000 --> 18:38.000
The source directory.

18:38.000 --> 18:39.000
Here.

18:39.000 --> 18:40.000
You will click.

18:40.000 --> 18:41.000
In blank space.

18:41.000 --> 18:42.000
Which is the lowest.

18:42.000 --> 18:43.000
You will click once.

18:43.000 --> 18:44.000
And here.

18:44.000 --> 18:45.000
You will create a file.

18:45.000 --> 18:46.000
Dot.

18:46.000 --> 18:47.000
Env.

18:47.000 --> 18:48.000
Dot.

18:48.000 --> 18:49.000
Env.

18:49.000 --> 18:50.000
Okay.

18:50.000 --> 18:51.000
This is the outermost.

18:51.000 --> 18:52.000
Right.

18:52.000 --> 18:53.000
This is out of the public too.

18:53.000 --> 18:54.000
Out of everything.

18:54.000 --> 18:55.000
Dot.

18:55.000 --> 18:56.000
Env.

18:56.000 --> 18:57.000
Dot.

18:57.000 --> 18:58.000
Envm.

18:58.000 --> 18:59.000
Dot.

18:59.000 --> 19:00.000
Envm.

19:00.000 --> 19:01.000
Dot.

19:01.000 --> 19:02.000
Envm.

19:02.000 --> 19:03.000
Dot.

19:03.000 --> 19:04.000
Envm.

19:04.000 --> 19:05.000
Dot.

19:05.000 --> 19:06.000
Envm.

19:06.000 --> 19:07.000
Dot.

19:07.000 --> 19:08.000
Envm.

19:08.000 --> 19:09.000
Dot.

19:09.000 --> 19:10.000
Envm.

19:10.000 --> 19:11.000
Dot.

19:11.000 --> 19:12.000
Envm.

19:12.000 --> 19:13.000
Dot.

19:13.000 --> 19:14.000
Envm

19:14.000 --> 19:15.000
For that.

19:15.000 --> 19:16.000
address.

19:16.000 --> 19:17.000
Here.

19:17.000 --> 19:18.000
We will wait before.

19:18.000 --> 19:19.000
We are waiting for the alcohol.

19:19.000 --> 19:20.000
Now.

19:20.000 --> 19:21.000
An.

19:21.000 --> 19:22.000
Going to the.

19:22.000 --> 19:23.000
Long.

19:23.000 --> 19:24.000
Down.

19:24.000 --> 19:25.000
An.

19:25.000 --> 19:30.000
white google client

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
now as soon as we write this thing

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
so what happens is that this thing

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
as soon as your code runs

19:36.000 --> 19:38.000
it will automatically be replaced with .env

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
now what will be the benefit of this

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
the benefit of this will be that

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
it will not appear in the browser in plain text

19:44.000 --> 19:47.000
so any attacker will not be able to steal your API

19:47.000 --> 19:49.000
it is now saved right

19:49.000 --> 19:51.000
so as soon as you write this thing in the client id

19:51.000 --> 19:53.000
so that white google client

19:53.000 --> 19:55.000
we had made a variable here

19:55.000 --> 19:57.000
it will automatically go there

19:57.000 --> 19:59.000
and that thing will not be shown in the browser

19:59.000 --> 20:01.000
ok

20:01.000 --> 20:03.000
so now we have saved this thing

20:03.000 --> 20:05.000
now what do we do

20:05.000 --> 20:07.000
now we go back to our browser

20:07.000 --> 20:09.000
and after going to the browser

20:09.000 --> 20:11.000
now we work

20:11.000 --> 20:13.000
we press continue with google

20:13.000 --> 20:15.000
as soon as we press

20:15.000 --> 20:17.000
here client id is showing

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
console is showing

20:19.000 --> 20:21.000
is there any problem

20:21.000 --> 20:23.000
ok

20:23.000 --> 20:25.000
gsi logger

20:25.000 --> 20:27.000
the given client id is not found

20:27.000 --> 20:29.000
so here I think

20:31.000 --> 20:33.000
problem

20:33.000 --> 20:35.000
why is it coming let me check

20:35.000 --> 20:37.000
so here it is saying

20:37.000 --> 20:39.000
client id is not found

20:39.000 --> 20:41.000
let us see if we put the right client id

20:41.000 --> 20:43.000
web client 1

20:43.000 --> 20:45.000
right client id is here

20:45.000 --> 20:47.000
once we go back

20:47.000 --> 20:49.000
and check

20:49.000 --> 20:51.000
so I go back

20:51.000 --> 20:53.000
and here

20:53.000 --> 20:55.000
our main.jsx

20:55.000 --> 20:57.000
inside this .env

20:57.000 --> 20:59.000
.env

20:59.000 --> 21:01.000
.env

21:01.000 --> 21:03.000
here once

21:03.000 --> 21:05.000
paste it

21:05.000 --> 21:07.000
paste it

21:07.000 --> 21:09.000
now we have pasted it

21:09.000 --> 21:11.000
now after this

21:11.000 --> 21:13.000
once we

21:13.000 --> 21:15.000
check it

21:15.000 --> 21:17.000
let us see once more

21:17.000 --> 21:19.000
ok

21:19.000 --> 21:21.000
ok

21:21.000 --> 21:23.000
I think now

21:23.000 --> 21:25.000
I think now

21:25.000 --> 21:27.000
we have copied something wrong

21:27.000 --> 21:29.000
so ok

21:29.000 --> 21:31.000
now we go back

21:31.000 --> 21:33.000
to our browser

21:33.000 --> 21:35.000
browser

21:35.000 --> 21:37.000
we have come to browser

21:37.000 --> 21:39.000
and we

21:39.000 --> 21:41.000
remove it

21:41.000 --> 21:43.000
continue with google

21:43.000 --> 21:45.000
ok

21:45.000 --> 21:47.000
I think

21:47.000 --> 21:49.000
I think

21:49.000 --> 21:53.000
again there is a problem given origin is not allowed for the client id

21:53.000 --> 21:57.000
ok so what is the problem here let me tell you

21:57.000 --> 22:01.000
the problem is that here this 127.0.0.1

22:01.000 --> 22:05.000
it never works so what you have to write here in url

22:05.000 --> 22:09.000
localhost colon 5173 slash login

22:09.000 --> 22:13.000
so here you have to write localhost 127

22:13.000 --> 22:17.000
ok for 127 you have to write localhost and now let's see

22:17.000 --> 22:21.000
what is written here now for now everything

22:21.000 --> 22:25.000
seems to be working and the spelling of login is wrong

22:25.000 --> 22:29.000
ok now login page is coming now see now

22:29.000 --> 22:33.000
the option is coming now as soon as you press continue with techie recon

22:33.000 --> 22:37.000
or you press continue with google now it will show you

22:37.000 --> 22:41.000
ok so it is something like this now as soon as we

22:41.000 --> 22:45.000
confirm continue with techie recon then what will happen is that

22:45.000 --> 22:47.000
basically login is done but you know

22:47.000 --> 22:51.000
it didn't work because after login we didn't specify anything

22:51.000 --> 22:55.000
what should happen after login right so now we will specify that
