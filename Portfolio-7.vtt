WEBVTT

00:06.000 --> 00:11.520
So now we have to create a user form and in that user portfolio form, the user will enter

00:11.520 --> 00:17.240
his details and after entering, he will save the details in the backend and after that

00:17.240 --> 00:21.760
a link will be generated, as soon as the user clicks on the link, he will reach his portfolio

00:21.760 --> 00:22.760
page.

00:22.760 --> 00:29.400
Basically, we will be saving his portfolio details in our backend and then whenever someone

00:29.400 --> 00:34.400
visits the site of the same user's portfolio, he will be shown the details there.

00:34.400 --> 00:35.400
So how will all this happen?

00:35.400 --> 00:40.400
This mechanism is for the future, but now we create a portfolio form in a simple design

00:40.400 --> 00:41.400
wise.

00:41.400 --> 00:48.400
So let's go to our VS Code for this and here we remove all these things like div, this

00:48.400 --> 00:49.400
is main.

00:49.400 --> 00:57.400
After this, here in the code section, whatever the basic layout of the portfolio form, it

00:57.400 --> 00:58.400
will be given to you.

00:58.400 --> 00:59.400
You can see it here.

00:59.400 --> 01:00.400
You have to come here and paste that thing.

01:00.400 --> 01:05.400
Now here I am going to explain all the things to you well, what is it, how is it, I will

01:05.400 --> 01:11.400
explain everything because this is not the main thing.

01:11.400 --> 01:12.400
Look, design is not the main thing.

01:12.400 --> 01:17.400
At the end of the day, we will do the design, you will do it, but the logic part is a little

01:17.400 --> 01:18.400
important.

01:18.400 --> 01:22.400
How the data is going to be saved in the backend, how the user is going to see his portfolio,

01:22.400 --> 01:24.400
these are a lot of logic things.

01:24.400 --> 01:28.400
So for this thing, we will understand it well and for the time being, we also understand

01:28.400 --> 01:29.400
what it is.

01:29.400 --> 01:38.400
So now for the time being, here we have given a background image in our form, like we have

01:38.400 --> 01:45.400
given a login page and those same images that we have given in the login page, we have just

01:45.400 --> 01:47.400
blurred this image a little more.

01:47.400 --> 01:49.400
Now how will it be known?

01:49.400 --> 01:53.400
Look, here we have blurred this image a little more.

01:53.400 --> 01:54.400
How much?

01:54.400 --> 01:55.400
Backdrop blur xl.

01:55.400 --> 01:57.400
That is, we have added an image in it.

01:57.400 --> 02:01.400
In that, we have kept it empty, so we have kept xl in it, that is, we have blurred it a little more.

02:01.400 --> 02:05.400
After that, we have put a logout button in which we will make the handle logout function.

02:05.400 --> 02:07.400
There is also a loading state.

02:07.400 --> 02:14.400
So what we will do here is that we will check whether the form has been loaded or not.

02:14.400 --> 02:17.400
You must have noticed one thing, when we go to the main page from login, then for a while

02:17.400 --> 02:19.400
that main page shows.

02:19.400 --> 02:20.400
Why does this happen?

02:20.400 --> 02:25.400
Because basically, the function is not executed so fast.

02:25.400 --> 02:26.400
So as long as that main page is showing.

02:26.400 --> 02:29.400
We don't want the user to see the content in it.

02:29.400 --> 02:31.400
So we will put a loading state there.

02:31.400 --> 02:32.400
What will we do?

02:32.400 --> 02:37.400
We will write that as soon as the user goes into the use effect, that is, as soon as it goes

02:37.400 --> 02:39.400
to the main page, the use effect will run there.

02:39.400 --> 02:43.400
So by then, we will set that state in loading.

02:43.400 --> 02:45.400
Okay, so we will do all this further.

02:45.400 --> 02:47.400
And there is also handle submit.

02:47.400 --> 02:49.400
So after submitting the form, what will happen?

02:49.400 --> 02:51.400
There will be a value fetch on the handle submit.

02:51.400 --> 02:55.400
And the object we used to do destructuring, we will do that and fetch the value from here.

02:56.400 --> 02:59.400
So here we will also take the image input from below.

02:59.400 --> 03:00.400
How to take the input?

03:00.400 --> 03:02.400
We will also see the image.

03:02.400 --> 03:05.400
And here we will show the image above that image.

03:05.400 --> 03:06.400
There are some things like this.

03:06.400 --> 03:08.400
Here we will take the name input.

03:08.400 --> 03:11.400
First name, last name, experience, about, role, skills.

03:11.400 --> 03:13.400
These are some things that we will take the input from here.

03:13.400 --> 03:15.400
And this is a basic form.

03:15.400 --> 03:17.400
The classes in this you will be able to see.

03:17.400 --> 03:18.400
ML is margin left.

03:18.400 --> 03:20.400
And background gray.

03:20.400 --> 03:21.400
Border gray.

03:21.400 --> 03:24.400
So all these things are basic things.

03:24.400 --> 03:25.400
And these are basic classes.

03:25.400 --> 03:27.400
You will be able to find them if you search them.

03:27.400 --> 03:29.400
And you will be able to understand by looking at them.

03:29.400 --> 03:30.400
Okay.

03:30.400 --> 03:33.400
Once we go to our browser.

03:33.400 --> 03:34.400
Web page.

03:34.400 --> 03:38.400
And here we will go to this page.

03:38.400 --> 03:40.400
So here some errors will be coming.

03:40.400 --> 03:43.400
Of course, because we have not made some functions.

03:43.400 --> 03:44.400
So see, errors will come.

03:44.400 --> 03:46.400
What is loading?

03:46.400 --> 03:49.400
And what are the things that have been defined?

03:49.400 --> 03:50.400
So what do we do?

03:50.400 --> 03:53.400
Let's quickly define them.

03:53.400 --> 03:55.400
And let's not implement now.

03:55.400 --> 03:57.400
Because we just want to see the layout.

03:57.400 --> 03:59.400
So we will go.

03:59.400 --> 04:01.400
And what are the things that we have to implement?

04:01.400 --> 04:03.400
We will see that once.

04:03.400 --> 04:05.400
So first we will make the states quickly.

04:05.400 --> 04:07.400
What will be the states?

04:07.400 --> 04:10.400
The first will be form data.

04:10.400 --> 04:12.400
That's portfolio and data.

04:12.400 --> 04:14.400
So we will name it form data.

04:14.400 --> 04:15.400
What will it do?

04:15.400 --> 04:16.400
I will tell you right now.

04:16.400 --> 04:23.400
Set p and data.

04:23.400 --> 04:24.400
Right.

04:25.400 --> 04:31.400
Use state.

04:31.400 --> 04:32.400
And here.

04:32.400 --> 04:35.400
What do we set it for now?

04:35.400 --> 04:39.400
We set it in the form of an object.

04:39.400 --> 04:41.400
Because the platform form data.

04:41.400 --> 04:42.400
Where will it come from?

04:42.400 --> 04:43.400
When the form will be submitted.

04:43.400 --> 04:44.400
This.

04:44.400 --> 04:45.400
Handle submit function.

04:45.400 --> 04:46.400
You must be seeing.

04:46.400 --> 04:47.400
On submit.

04:47.400 --> 04:48.400
So as soon as the form will be submitted.

04:48.400 --> 04:49.400
Handle submit will run.

04:49.400 --> 04:50.400
And handle submit will create an object.

04:50.400 --> 04:53.400
And that object will be set in the platform data.

04:53.400 --> 04:54.400
We will see how that thing will happen now.

04:54.400 --> 04:55.400
Constant.

04:55.400 --> 04:57.400
And here is a loading thing.

04:57.400 --> 04:58.400
For loading.

04:58.400 --> 05:00.400
We set a state here.

05:00.400 --> 05:03.400
And set loading here.

05:03.400 --> 05:06.400
We have to keep that.

05:06.400 --> 05:08.400
Set loading.

05:08.400 --> 05:10.400
After this.

05:10.400 --> 05:12.400
Using this.

05:12.400 --> 05:13.400
Use state.

05:13.400 --> 05:15.400
By using.

05:15.400 --> 05:18.400
We set it to false for now.

05:18.400 --> 05:21.400
Because now we don't want our loader to work.

05:21.400 --> 05:22.400
Right.

05:22.400 --> 05:23.400
Now after this.

05:23.400 --> 05:26.400
The second thing.

05:26.400 --> 05:27.400
What is this?

05:27.400 --> 05:29.400
This visible.

05:29.400 --> 05:31.400
What is this visible thing?

05:31.400 --> 05:32.400
I will tell you.

05:32.400 --> 05:34.400
Here you see below.

05:34.400 --> 05:35.400
In the second.

05:35.400 --> 05:36.400
In the last.

05:36.400 --> 05:38.400
When our form is submitted.

05:38.400 --> 05:40.400
Our form is submitted.

05:40.400 --> 05:41.400
This button is submit button.

05:41.400 --> 05:42.400
Okay.

05:42.400 --> 05:44.400
So the first thing is in submit button.

05:44.400 --> 05:45.400
This loading will be written.

05:45.400 --> 05:47.400
As soon as the user clicks submit.

05:47.400 --> 05:48.400
As soon as the user clicks submit.

05:48.400 --> 05:49.400
Then loading will be written.

05:49.400 --> 05:50.400
Until.

05:50.400 --> 05:51.400
Until the form is not submitted.

05:51.400 --> 05:52.400
In the backend.

05:52.400 --> 05:53.400
Till then.

05:53.400 --> 05:54.400
This loading will be written.

05:54.400 --> 05:55.400
All these things will be clear to you.

05:55.400 --> 05:56.400
What is this?

05:56.400 --> 05:58.400
What have I done in one click?

05:58.400 --> 06:00.400
Everything will be clear.

06:00.400 --> 06:02.400
What is this visible here?

06:02.400 --> 06:05.400
This visible will give you the URL of the portfolio.

06:05.400 --> 06:06.400
Means.

06:06.400 --> 06:07.400
When the user clicks submit.

06:07.400 --> 06:09.400
Then the URL of the portfolio will be generated.

06:09.400 --> 06:11.400
That thing will be showing you here.

06:11.400 --> 06:12.400
So until.

06:12.400 --> 06:14.400
We set it to state.

06:14.400 --> 06:19.400
Const is visible.

06:19.400 --> 06:20.400
Is visible.

06:20.400 --> 06:21.400
And set.

06:21.400 --> 06:22.400
Is.

06:22.400 --> 06:23.400
Visible.

06:23.400 --> 06:24.400
Is equals to.

06:24.400 --> 06:25.400
Use state.

06:25.400 --> 06:26.400
And now we will give false.

06:26.400 --> 06:27.400
False.

06:27.400 --> 06:28.400
Okay.

06:28.400 --> 06:29.400
Now we have done this thing.

06:29.400 --> 06:30.400
Now after this one thing comes.

06:30.400 --> 06:31.400
That is loading.

06:31.400 --> 06:32.400
Loading what?

06:32.400 --> 06:33.400
Button loading state.

06:33.400 --> 06:34.400
Means.

06:34.400 --> 06:35.400
I will tell you what is.

06:35.400 --> 06:36.400
Set is B loading.

06:36.400 --> 06:37.400
And this is for submit button.

06:37.400 --> 06:38.400
Here we will put the handle submit function.

06:38.400 --> 06:39.400
Right?

06:39.400 --> 06:40.400
We will put the submit function.

06:40.400 --> 06:41.400
So.

06:41.400 --> 06:42.400
So.

06:42.400 --> 06:43.400
So.

06:43.400 --> 06:44.400
So.

06:44.400 --> 06:45.400
So.

06:45.400 --> 06:46.400
So.

06:46.400 --> 06:47.400
So.

06:47.400 --> 06:48.400
So.

06:48.400 --> 06:49.400
So.

06:49.400 --> 06:50.400
So.

06:50.400 --> 06:51.400
So.

06:51.400 --> 06:52.400
So.

06:52.400 --> 06:53.400
So.

06:53.400 --> 06:54.400
And here we will put the submit function.

06:54.400 --> 07:18.760
Const hand

07:18.760 --> 07:19.760
submit.

07:19.760 --> 07:23.760
Now there is a handleLogout which we will implement now.

07:23.760 --> 07:25.760
What is handleLogout?

07:25.760 --> 07:26.760
What will handleLogout do?

07:26.760 --> 07:28.760
As soon as the user clicks in logout,

07:28.760 --> 07:30.760
this is the logout text here,

07:30.760 --> 07:31.760
there is a div here,

07:31.760 --> 07:33.760
as soon as the user clicks in logout,

07:33.760 --> 07:34.760
the user will be logged out.

07:34.760 --> 07:36.760
And handleLogout function will be called first.

07:36.760 --> 07:37.760
So how did this happen?

07:37.760 --> 07:38.760
I will tell you.

07:41.760 --> 07:42.760
What will happen there?

07:42.760 --> 07:44.760
See, how did logout happen?

07:44.760 --> 07:45.760
You understand.

07:45.760 --> 07:46.760
How did login happen?

07:46.760 --> 07:47.760
First understand this.

07:47.760 --> 07:48.760
UserInfo object was created

07:48.760 --> 07:50.760
and we check that object.

07:50.760 --> 07:51.760
We do one thing.

07:51.760 --> 07:53.760
We delete UserInfo object.

07:53.760 --> 07:54.760
As soon as the user clicks in logout,

07:54.760 --> 07:56.760
UserInfo object will be deleted.

07:56.760 --> 07:58.760
And when UserInfo object is deleted,

07:58.760 --> 07:59.760
then user will be logged out.

07:59.760 --> 08:00.760
Right?

08:00.760 --> 08:01.760
So we do this.

08:01.760 --> 08:03.760
localStorage.clear

08:03.760 --> 08:04.760
And what will we write here?

08:04.760 --> 08:05.760
Nothing.

08:05.760 --> 08:07.760
If we do localStorage.clear,

08:07.760 --> 08:09.760
then localStorage will be cleared.

08:09.760 --> 08:10.760
Then what will we do?

08:10.760 --> 08:11.760
We will navigate the user.

08:11.760 --> 08:13.760
Where will we navigate?

08:13.760 --> 08:14.760
Forward slash.

08:14.760 --> 08:16.760
Means we will navigate to the main page.

08:16.760 --> 08:18.760
So that page will be reloaded in a way.

08:18.760 --> 08:19.760
As soon as localStorage is cleared,

08:19.760 --> 08:21.760
then what will happen to the main page?

08:21.760 --> 08:22.760
That once it had to reload.

08:22.760 --> 08:23.760
Right?

08:23.760 --> 08:25.760
It had to reload after changing something in localStorage.

08:25.760 --> 08:27.760
So we cleared localStorage.

08:27.760 --> 08:28.760
After clearing localStorage,

08:28.760 --> 08:31.760
we will redirect it back to the main page.

08:31.760 --> 08:33.760
So the main page first checks

08:33.760 --> 08:35.760
whether there is anything in localStorage or not.

08:35.760 --> 08:36.760
Now if it does not get anything,

08:36.760 --> 08:37.760
then it will redirect it to the login page.

08:37.760 --> 08:38.760
Do you understand?

08:38.760 --> 08:39.760
Basic logic.

08:40.760 --> 08:41.760
Now what we do here is

08:41.760 --> 08:43.760
once we make navigate here,

08:43.760 --> 08:44.760
which we have already made.

08:44.760 --> 08:45.760
Okay.

08:45.760 --> 08:46.760
Once we save it,

08:46.760 --> 08:47.760
and go back to our browser.

08:47.760 --> 08:49.760
And once we go back to our browser,

08:49.760 --> 08:51.760
and once we go back to our browser,

08:51.760 --> 08:52.760
let's see if there is any error

08:52.760 --> 08:54.760
which is coming.

08:54.760 --> 08:56.760
Preview image is not defined.

08:56.760 --> 08:57.760
Okay.

08:57.760 --> 08:58.760
Preview image is not defined.

08:58.760 --> 09:01.760
So we have to make a preview image as well.

09:01.760 --> 09:02.760
So okay.

09:02.760 --> 09:03.760
What is this preview image?

09:03.760 --> 09:04.760
I will also tell you this.

09:04.760 --> 09:06.760
So we go back to the code.

09:06.760 --> 09:09.760
And here we have to make a state

09:09.760 --> 09:11.760
by doing preview image.

09:11.760 --> 09:13.760
Let me tell you what it is.

09:13.760 --> 09:15.760
We come here.

09:15.760 --> 09:16.760
And after coming here,

09:16.760 --> 09:17.760
we come here.

09:17.760 --> 09:18.760
We come here.

09:18.760 --> 09:20.760
And after coming here,

09:20.760 --> 09:21.760
we come here.

09:21.760 --> 09:24.760
Here we make the state of the preview image.

09:24.760 --> 09:26.760
And now I will explain what it is.

09:26.760 --> 09:27.760
See here,

09:27.760 --> 09:28.760
preview image is used

09:28.760 --> 09:31.760
because when you see in our form,

09:31.760 --> 09:35.760
we have made an image input in the form.

09:35.760 --> 09:37.760
You are seeing type equal to file.

09:37.760 --> 09:40.760
We have made an image file input.

09:40.760 --> 09:42.760
And this image file,

09:42.760 --> 09:44.760
what we will basically do is

09:44.760 --> 09:45.760
you must have seen our form.

09:45.760 --> 09:48.760
Let me show you how our form looks like.

09:48.760 --> 09:51.760
So we are going to our browser.

09:51.760 --> 09:59.760
And here you will remember that our form is of this type.

09:59.760 --> 10:00.760
It was of this type, right?

10:00.760 --> 10:01.760
It was some form like this.

10:01.760 --> 10:05.760
Here we have input the file by choosing the file.

10:05.760 --> 10:07.760
As soon as a person clicks on the choose file,

10:07.760 --> 10:16.760
instead of the placeholder image, the user will see the file that the user has chosen.

10:16.760 --> 10:22.760
So if you choose the file from here, you will see the file after choosing it.

10:22.760 --> 10:25.760
So we want to do the same thing here.

10:25.760 --> 10:27.760
So let me show you how.

10:27.760 --> 10:30.760
So now we go here.

10:30.760 --> 10:35.760
And here we have input the file from the user.

10:35.760 --> 10:36.760
In the choose file button,

10:36.760 --> 10:37.760
we have input the file from the user.

10:37.760 --> 10:40.760
And after inputting the file,

10:40.760 --> 10:47.760
we have set the placeholder image to the placeholder image.

10:47.760 --> 10:48.760
We have set the preview image.

10:48.760 --> 10:50.760
Now let me show you how we will do this.

10:50.760 --> 10:53.760
So by default, the hacker image that you saw,

10:53.760 --> 10:54.760
that is this.

10:54.760 --> 10:56.760
So this is set in this state.

10:56.760 --> 10:57.760
So what will happen?

10:57.760 --> 10:59.760
First the user will set the file here.

10:59.760 --> 11:01.760
He will set it here.

11:01.760 --> 11:02.760
Here.

11:02.760 --> 11:05.760
And here the load function will be called.

11:05.760 --> 11:06.760
Which will be clicked in the choose file.

11:06.760 --> 11:09.760
As soon as you click in the choose file, the load function will be called.

11:09.760 --> 11:11.760
And what will the load file do?

11:11.760 --> 11:14.760
After doing everything, it will set the preview image.

11:14.760 --> 11:16.760
In this image, it will set its URL.

11:16.760 --> 11:18.760
It will generate a URL and it will set it.

11:18.760 --> 11:19.760
Okay.

11:19.760 --> 11:21.760
By default, the URL that will be set is this.

11:21.760 --> 11:23.760
So now what is the load file function?

11:23.760 --> 11:24.760
Once we make that.

11:24.760 --> 11:27.760
So the load file function is very easy.

11:27.760 --> 11:30.760
And here you will also learn to input the image.

11:30.760 --> 11:32.760
So you go down here.

11:32.760 --> 11:35.760
And we make the handle just below the submit.

11:35.760 --> 11:38.760
Or you can make it anywhere in the top.

11:38.760 --> 11:39.760
By the way, we make it here.

11:39.760 --> 11:41.760
So this is our load file function.

11:41.760 --> 11:42.760
What is it doing?

11:42.760 --> 11:44.760
Let's see it once nicely.

11:44.760 --> 11:47.760
Load file is capturing an event.

11:47.760 --> 11:49.760
The event is basically whatever the user is typing in the form.

11:49.760 --> 11:50.760
It must be writing.

11:50.760 --> 11:51.760
Whatever it is doing, it is an event.

11:51.760 --> 11:52.760
Okay.

11:52.760 --> 11:55.760
Load file is capturing the same event.

11:55.760 --> 11:58.760
And from that, it will capture only that type of event.

11:58.760 --> 12:00.760
Which will be of the file type.

12:00.760 --> 12:02.760
That is, the file we said input.file.

12:02.760 --> 12:04.760
Here only what the user does?

12:04.760 --> 12:05.760
What the user does?

12:05.760 --> 12:06.760
He will click choose file.

12:06.760 --> 12:08.760
And here where choose file will click.

12:08.760 --> 12:09.760
What is its type?

12:09.760 --> 12:10.760
File.

12:10.760 --> 12:12.760
File type is you can see.

12:12.760 --> 12:14.760
We did the type equal to file.

12:14.760 --> 12:16.760
And what will it do here?

12:16.760 --> 12:17.760
This function.

12:17.760 --> 12:20.760
This is the load file function.

12:20.760 --> 12:22.760
This will only work for file type.

12:22.760 --> 12:24.760
So here as soon as the user clicks on choose file.

12:24.760 --> 12:26.760
Then it will be given the option to input.

12:26.760 --> 12:29.760
So we said that only that one file can be inputted at once.

12:29.760 --> 12:30.760
So we made the file zero.

12:30.760 --> 12:32.760
That all the files it will see while inputting.

12:32.760 --> 12:33.760
When the user choose file.

12:33.760 --> 12:35.760
When the user is choosing file from desktop.

12:35.760 --> 12:38.760
Then from that only one file can be chosen.

12:38.760 --> 12:40.760
And this file reader.

12:40.760 --> 12:43.760
It will ensure that the user input is a file.

12:43.760 --> 12:44.760
Okay.

12:44.760 --> 12:46.760
So now this thing is.

12:46.760 --> 12:48.760
How did we know that the file will be inputted?

12:48.760 --> 12:50.760
We did the type equal to file.

12:50.760 --> 12:51.760
And here it checked.

12:51.760 --> 12:53.760
And as soon as the user.

12:53.760 --> 12:55.760
The file.

12:55.760 --> 12:57.760
As soon as it is loaded.

12:57.760 --> 12:59.760
As soon as it is loaded.

12:59.760 --> 13:01.760
What will it do?

13:01.760 --> 13:04.760
It will create a data URL form.

13:04.760 --> 13:06.760
Means it will create a URL.

13:06.760 --> 13:08.760
It is a very long URL.

13:08.760 --> 13:10.760
It will create that file.

13:10.760 --> 13:12.760
And it will set it in set preview image.

13:12.760 --> 13:14.760
Means it will set it here.

13:14.760 --> 13:16.760
So by default the value was this.

13:16.760 --> 13:18.760
But as soon as it is loaded.

13:18.760 --> 13:20.760
It will create a URL and set it by itself.

13:20.760 --> 13:22.760
And what is here?

13:22.760 --> 13:24.760
Here is the same thing.

13:24.760 --> 13:26.760
That the file reader.

13:26.760 --> 13:27.760
The file reader.

13:27.760 --> 13:28.760
This is gone.

13:28.760 --> 13:29.760
File reader.

13:29.760 --> 13:30.760
That any incoming data.

13:30.760 --> 13:32.760
Will work to convert it as a data URL.

13:32.760 --> 13:34.760
So this thing is decided here.

13:34.760 --> 13:35.760
So you will understand.

13:35.760 --> 13:36.760
It is very easy.

13:36.760 --> 13:37.760
First we took the input.

13:37.760 --> 13:38.760
From the input.

13:38.760 --> 13:39.760
We ensured that it is the same file.

13:39.760 --> 13:40.760
By doing a file reader.

13:40.760 --> 13:42.760
We took the JavaScript functionality.

13:42.760 --> 13:43.760
And we said.

13:43.760 --> 13:44.760
Brother.

13:44.760 --> 13:45.760
The file reader which gives the data URL.

13:45.760 --> 13:47.760
We have to set it in the preview image.

13:47.760 --> 13:48.760
Done.

13:48.760 --> 13:51.760
And then we show that data URL with the preview image.

13:51.760 --> 13:52.760
So let's see how our form looks.

13:52.760 --> 13:54.760
So we came to our form page.

13:54.760 --> 13:56.760
And our form page looks something like this.

13:56.760 --> 13:57.760
Okay.

13:57.760 --> 13:58.760
All those styles.

13:58.760 --> 13:59.760
All the things we have added from Tailwind.

13:59.760 --> 14:01.760
And we have added functionality here.

14:01.760 --> 14:02.760
We have added input boxes here.

14:02.760 --> 14:03.760
All these have come.

14:03.760 --> 14:05.760
Now the method of choose file.

14:05.760 --> 14:06.760
Which we had added recently.

14:06.760 --> 14:07.760
That has also come.

14:07.760 --> 14:08.760
So what will happen.

14:08.760 --> 14:09.760
As soon as we click on choose file.

14:09.760 --> 14:11.760
So here we will get options.

14:11.760 --> 14:13.760
To import any one of these files.

14:13.760 --> 14:14.760
Right.

14:14.760 --> 14:16.760
Now we can take only one file.

14:16.760 --> 14:17.760
Because we have.

14:17.760 --> 14:18.760
Files.

14:18.760 --> 14:19.760
Zero.

14:19.760 --> 14:20.760
Means.

14:20.760 --> 14:21.760
Input.

14:21.760 --> 14:22.760
One.

14:22.760 --> 14:23.760
File.

14:23.760 --> 14:24.760
Right.

14:24.760 --> 14:25.760
So now if we click on any screenshot.

14:25.760 --> 14:26.760
Or any image.

14:26.760 --> 14:27.760
In open.

14:27.760 --> 14:28.760
So here.

14:28.760 --> 14:29.760
See.

14:29.760 --> 14:30.760
The file has been set.

14:30.760 --> 14:31.760
Do you understand.

14:31.760 --> 14:32.760
As soon as we clicked on choose file.

14:32.760 --> 14:34.760
It created a data url.

14:34.760 --> 14:35.760
A data url.

14:35.760 --> 14:36.760
Means.

14:36.760 --> 14:37.760
It created a long and wide url.

14:37.760 --> 14:38.760
And that url.

14:38.760 --> 14:39.760
That is.

14:39.760 --> 14:40.760
Here.

14:40.760 --> 14:41.760
Has come in the preview image.

14:41.760 --> 14:42.760
And set.

14:42.760 --> 14:43.760
But our form.

14:43.760 --> 14:44.760
Doesn't look good.

14:44.760 --> 14:45.760
Right.

14:45.760 --> 14:46.760
Means.

14:46.760 --> 14:47.760
There are some things like this in it.

14:47.760 --> 14:49.760
So now what can we do to make it look good.

14:49.760 --> 14:50.760
To make it look good.

14:50.760 --> 14:51.760
What we do is.

14:51.760 --> 14:52.760
We go to this code.

14:52.760 --> 14:53.760
And.

14:53.760 --> 14:54.760
You.

14:54.760 --> 14:55.760
Have to do one thing.

14:55.760 --> 14:56.760
You have to go to your.

14:56.760 --> 14:57.760
Main.

14:57.760 --> 14:58.760
Index.

14:58.760 --> 14:59.760
Css.

14:59.760 --> 15:00.760
Now.

15:00.760 --> 15:01.760
In index.

15:01.760 --> 15:02.760
Css.

15:02.760 --> 15:03.760
We.

15:03.760 --> 15:04.760
Will add some styles.

15:04.760 --> 15:05.760
Here.

15:05.760 --> 15:06.760
So.

15:06.760 --> 15:07.760
Those styles of index.

15:07.760 --> 15:08.760
Css.

15:08.760 --> 15:09.760
Have been given to you.

15:09.760 --> 15:10.760
In your code section.

15:10.760 --> 15:11.760
You just copy it.

15:11.760 --> 15:12.760
And.

15:12.760 --> 15:13.760
Put it.

15:13.760 --> 15:14.760
Everything will be set.

15:14.760 --> 15:15.760
What happened here.

15:15.760 --> 15:16.760
Let me tell you.

15:16.760 --> 15:17.760
What we did.

15:17.760 --> 15:18.760
What we did.

15:18.760 --> 15:19.760
That we.

15:19.760 --> 15:20.760
First of all.

15:20.760 --> 15:21.760
A monster.

15:21.760 --> 15:22.760
Red.

15:22.760 --> 15:23.760
There is a.

15:23.760 --> 15:24.760
Font.

15:24.760 --> 15:25.760
That font.

15:25.760 --> 15:26.760
We have used here.

15:26.760 --> 15:27.760
That we.

15:27.760 --> 15:28.760
We have imported that thing.

15:28.760 --> 15:29.760
From.

15:29.760 --> 15:30.760
Google.

15:30.760 --> 15:31.760
Fonts.

15:31.760 --> 15:32.760
So.

15:32.760 --> 15:33.760
It is not even used.

15:33.760 --> 15:34.760
I will tell you.

15:34.760 --> 15:35.760
That means.

15:35.760 --> 15:36.760
We have basically.

15:36.760 --> 15:37.760
A monster.

15:37.760 --> 15:38.760
Red.

15:38.760 --> 15:39.760
Font.

15:39.760 --> 15:40.760
That is.

15:40.760 --> 15:41.760
Used.

15:41.760 --> 15:42.760
After that.

15:42.760 --> 15:43.760
Main.

15:43.760 --> 15:44.760
Thing.

15:44.760 --> 15:45.760
This.

15:45.760 --> 15:46.760
Image.

15:46.760 --> 15:47.760
Input.

15:47.760 --> 15:48.760
Image.

15:48.760 --> 15:49.760
Input.

15:49.760 --> 15:50.760
What have we done.

15:50.760 --> 15:51.760
That.

15:51.760 --> 15:52.760
