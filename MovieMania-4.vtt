00:06.000 --> 00:12.000
So far we have seen how to use API to search data of movies.

00:12.000 --> 00:17.000
Now the second thing is that we have to set the search data that we have now.

00:17.000 --> 00:20.000
And then we have to show the data to the user.

00:20.000 --> 00:23.000
So now to set the data we use states in react.

00:23.000 --> 00:24.000
So what are states?

00:24.000 --> 00:26.000
States are basically used to set the data.

00:26.000 --> 00:28.000
For now you know this much.

00:28.000 --> 00:30.000
So how are states written?

00:30.000 --> 00:32.000
So you define a constant state here.

00:32.000 --> 00:39.000
And after defining a const you open it with a square bracket.

00:39.000 --> 00:42.000
You put two parameters in the square bracket.

00:42.000 --> 00:45.000
The first parameter is variable.

00:45.000 --> 00:47.000
And the second parameter is set the variable.

00:47.000 --> 00:50.000
So in the first parameter you declare any variable.

00:50.000 --> 00:52.000
And in the second you set it.

00:52.000 --> 00:56.000
For example, we are searching movies here.

00:56.000 --> 00:58.000
And then the data of that movie.

00:58.000 --> 00:59.000
We have to set it.

00:59.000 --> 01:01.000
So we define it as set movies.

01:01.000 --> 01:03.000
These two things we define here.

01:03.000 --> 01:07.000
Now basically a use state hook is applied to it.

01:07.000 --> 01:08.000
Use state hook.

01:08.000 --> 01:12.000
So to use it what you have to do first is to import it from here.

01:12.000 --> 01:16.000
Which has automatically been imported above due to the functionality of VS Code.

01:16.000 --> 01:20.000
Now in this we define what kind of data we are going to set.

01:20.000 --> 01:22.000
Like the set movies that we will set here.

01:22.000 --> 01:23.000
What kind of data will it be?

01:23.000 --> 01:25.000
So in our case it is a list of movies.

01:25.000 --> 01:27.000
That means when you saw that we searched movies.

01:27.000 --> 01:29.000
So a list of movies came.

01:29.000 --> 01:31.000
So we have to set it.

01:31.000 --> 01:34.000
So we set a list of movies here.

01:34.000 --> 01:37.000
So for this we have used an array here.

01:37.000 --> 01:41.000
And list of movies means that we are storing an array of movies.

01:41.000 --> 01:42.000
Second thing.

01:42.000 --> 01:44.000
Now we are setting these movies.

01:44.000 --> 01:47.000
For this we will first search the name of the movie from the user.

01:47.000 --> 01:49.000
Then we will set the same data.

01:49.000 --> 01:51.000
So when the user will search.

01:51.000 --> 01:54.000
So for that also we have to make a state.

01:54.000 --> 01:56.000
We name it as search term.

01:56.000 --> 01:58.000
Whatever the user will search.

01:58.000 --> 01:59.000
It will be set in this.

01:59.000 --> 02:01.000
And set search term.

02:03.000 --> 02:05.000
Now slowly you will understand everything well.

02:05.000 --> 02:07.000
When we will do the code now.

02:07.000 --> 02:09.000
So in this basically what we will do.

02:09.000 --> 02:11.000
We will set the search term of the user.

02:11.000 --> 02:13.000
Whatever the user wants to search.

02:13.000 --> 02:15.000
It will be set here.

02:15.000 --> 02:17.000
So here we have used an empty string.

02:17.000 --> 02:20.000
Because here we will want the user to set a string.

02:20.000 --> 02:22.000
He will search a string.

02:22.000 --> 02:23.000
Right.

02:23.000 --> 02:24.000
A string will search the user.

02:24.000 --> 02:25.000
So here we will.

02:25.000 --> 02:28.000
Here we will set the value as a string.

02:28.000 --> 02:30.000
Now our work is down here.

02:30.000 --> 02:32.000
Near the return.

02:32.000 --> 02:34.000
Where we will write our jsx.

02:34.000 --> 02:36.000
And there only the user will be shown in the web page.

02:36.000 --> 02:39.000
So here the first thing we have to make.

02:39.000 --> 02:42.000
That is a search box.

02:42.000 --> 02:45.000
So for this we will first make a div to make a search box.

02:45.000 --> 02:47.000
Whose class name we will give app.

02:47.000 --> 02:50.000
So you will write dot app.

02:50.000 --> 02:52.000
So because of the functionality of the ds code.

02:52.000 --> 02:53.000
A div will be created automatically.

02:53.000 --> 02:55.000
Whose class name will be app.

02:55.000 --> 02:57.000
After this you have to give it an id.

02:57.000 --> 02:58.000
Search.

02:58.000 --> 03:01.000
We will make this div with the search id.

03:01.000 --> 03:03.000
And in this we will make one more div.

03:03.000 --> 03:05.000
This is the main div.

03:05.000 --> 03:07.000
In which there will be a full search box.

03:07.000 --> 03:09.000
We will make one more div.

03:09.000 --> 03:11.000
Whose class name we will give search.

03:11.000 --> 03:14.000
So this is the input for the search box.

03:14.000 --> 03:16.000
And here in this we will make an input.

03:16.000 --> 03:17.000
Sorry.

03:17.000 --> 03:19.000
In this we will use an input.

03:19.000 --> 03:21.000
We will make an input tag.

03:21.000 --> 03:22.000
What will happen in the input tag.

03:22.000 --> 03:24.000
Basically there will be a search input.

03:24.000 --> 03:27.000
So here type is equal to text already.

03:27.000 --> 03:28.000
Attribute is set.

03:28.000 --> 03:30.000
Second attribute we will put is placeholder.

03:30.000 --> 03:33.000
In which by default it will be written search for movies.

03:33.000 --> 03:37.000
So by default user will see this thing in the search box.

03:37.000 --> 03:40.000
Second thing is value.

03:40.000 --> 03:43.000
Means we have to set the value here.

03:43.000 --> 03:44.000
In the search box.

03:44.000 --> 03:46.000
Whatever user will search.

03:46.000 --> 03:48.000
We have to set that value.

03:48.000 --> 03:51.000
So we have already made a state above here.

03:51.000 --> 03:52.000
By doing set search term.

03:52.000 --> 03:53.000
And by doing search term.

03:53.000 --> 03:55.000
So we will put this thing in value.

03:55.000 --> 03:58.000
Because whatever user will search will be set in this.

03:58.000 --> 04:01.000
And the same thing will be shown in the search box.

04:01.000 --> 04:05.000
So here we will set the search term in value.

04:05.000 --> 04:09.000
And the second attribute will be onChange.

04:09.000 --> 04:11.000
Now what will onChange do?

04:11.000 --> 04:13.000
Whenever any user will type.

04:13.000 --> 04:16.000
So this will be put in the search term.

04:16.000 --> 04:19.000
Means for example users typed ironman.

04:19.000 --> 04:22.000
So it will set ironman in the search term.

04:22.000 --> 04:25.000
So here we will make a callback function.

04:25.000 --> 04:27.000
In which we will capture an event.

04:27.000 --> 04:29.000
Event means whatever user will be typing.

04:29.000 --> 04:31.000
We will capture the event of that.

04:31.000 --> 04:32.000
And we will set it here.

04:32.000 --> 04:35.000
Set in the search term.

04:35.000 --> 04:37.000
So we will set some value like this.

04:37.000 --> 04:42.000
In which we will write e.target.value.

04:42.000 --> 04:45.000
So now we will understand what is it.

04:45.000 --> 04:47.000
We basically said here.

04:47.000 --> 04:49.000
Whatever user is typing.

04:49.000 --> 04:50.000
Capture it as an event.

04:50.000 --> 04:51.000
E.

04:51.000 --> 04:53.000
We gave the name of that event as e.

04:53.000 --> 04:55.000
We said whatever user is typing.

04:55.000 --> 04:56.000
Whatever is typing.

04:56.000 --> 04:59.000
We will set it in the set search term.

04:59.000 --> 05:01.000
To set in the search term.

05:01.000 --> 05:04.000
We will use the set search term and set it.

05:04.000 --> 05:06.000
So basically whatever user will search here.

05:06.000 --> 05:07.000
It will be shown here.

05:07.000 --> 05:09.000
So for now let's see the web page.

05:09.000 --> 05:12.000
There we should get a search box.

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
Very basic.

05:14.000 --> 05:16.000
So once we go.

05:16.000 --> 05:18.000
So see our web page.

05:18.000 --> 05:20.000
It has a very basic search box.

05:20.000 --> 05:21.000
On top.

05:21.000 --> 05:23.000
Now here for now there is an error.

05:23.000 --> 05:26.000
So this error will be coming because of API.

05:26.000 --> 05:28.000
We will fix this too.

05:28.000 --> 05:31.000
But for now you saw how it was.

05:31.000 --> 05:32.000
After this we do one thing.

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
We go back to the code editor.

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
And we check our terminal once.

05:36.000 --> 05:37.000
What error is coming in it.

05:37.000 --> 05:39.000
There is a warning.

05:39.000 --> 05:40.000
That brother.

05:40.000 --> 05:42.000
You have made movie and set movies.

05:42.000 --> 05:44.000
But you never used it.

05:44.000 --> 05:46.000
So this is also true.

05:46.000 --> 05:48.000
We have made set movies and movies.

05:48.000 --> 05:49.000
We did not use it.

05:49.000 --> 05:51.000
We will use it slowly.

05:51.000 --> 05:53.000
Before that I want one thing.

05:53.000 --> 05:58.000
That you have given CSS in the code section.

05:58.000 --> 06:01.000
In which you have given CSS of the whole page.

06:01.000 --> 06:03.000
Style sheets have been given.

06:03.000 --> 06:04.000
You copy it.

06:04.000 --> 06:07.000
Go to app.css and paste it.

06:07.000 --> 06:09.000
So I have already copied it.

06:09.000 --> 06:11.000
So we will go to app.css.

06:11.000 --> 06:14.000
And here we will remove whatever is already there.

06:14.000 --> 06:17.000
And we will paste what we have copied there.

06:17.000 --> 06:19.000
Because the whole CSS.

06:19.000 --> 06:23.000
We wanted that you do not waste your time in design.

06:23.000 --> 06:24.000
You learn logic.

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
Because the questions asked in the interview.

06:26.000 --> 06:27.000
Wherever you go.

06:27.000 --> 06:29.000
So you are working on the main logic.

06:29.000 --> 06:30.000
Styles.

06:30.000 --> 06:35.000
You can do it by searching from chrome, internet, chat, gpt, google.

06:35.000 --> 06:37.000
This style is not the matter.

06:37.000 --> 06:38.000
The thing is logic.

06:38.000 --> 06:41.000
So we want you to focus on logic.

06:41.000 --> 06:43.000
So we have already given you styles.

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
We will explain you the styles too.

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
So now we check the app once.

06:47.000 --> 06:49.000
So see this.

06:49.000 --> 06:52.000
Here our web page looks something like this.

06:52.000 --> 06:53.000
You can see.

06:53.000 --> 06:55.000
It has become a search box.

06:55.000 --> 06:57.000
And all these things have happened.

06:57.000 --> 06:58.000
Right.

06:58.000 --> 07:02.000
So this is our basic web page.

07:02.000 --> 07:05.000
After this.

07:05.000 --> 07:07.000
The second thing is.

07:07.000 --> 07:08.000
Now we have to do.

07:08.000 --> 07:10.000
Let's put a search image too.

07:10.000 --> 07:11.000
Search box.

07:11.000 --> 07:13.000
The search box that is visible to us.

07:13.000 --> 07:15.000
It is also necessary to see an image in it.

07:15.000 --> 07:17.000
So we put an image somewhere here.

07:17.000 --> 07:19.000
So what you have to do to put a search button.

07:19.000 --> 07:20.000
First of all.

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
You have to go to your source folder.

07:22.000 --> 07:24.000
There you have to click on the source folder.

07:24.000 --> 07:26.000
And you have to make a new file.

07:26.000 --> 07:28.000
Which you have to name as search.svg.

07:28.000 --> 07:30.000
Search.svg.

07:30.000 --> 07:32.000
We will put a svg code in it.

07:32.000 --> 07:35.000
Search image.

07:35.000 --> 07:37.000
The search button will be your svg.

07:37.000 --> 07:43.000
So for that we have given you a svg code by doing a search.svg in the code section.

07:43.000 --> 07:45.000
You just have to copy it from there and paste it in it.

07:45.000 --> 07:47.000
Now what you have to do.

07:47.000 --> 07:50.000
You just have to import it in your app.

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
And you have to use it as a search icon.

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
So what you have to do to import.

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
You have to write import here.

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
And you can give any name to this search svg.

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
I have given the name by doing a search icon.

08:00.000 --> 08:03.000
And you can write the path of this svg here.

08:03.000 --> 08:04.000
Search.svg.

08:04.000 --> 08:07.000
We have imported search.svg in the code with the name of this search icon.

08:07.000 --> 08:09.000
Now what we have to do.

08:09.000 --> 08:13.000
Now we have to make an image tag just below the input tag.

08:13.000 --> 08:14.000
And in the image tag.

08:14.000 --> 08:16.000
We have to give a search icon in the source.

08:16.000 --> 08:18.000
Which we have just imported.

08:18.000 --> 08:20.000
We have to just give a search icon here.

08:20.000 --> 08:21.000
By doing a search icon.

08:21.000 --> 08:22.000
We have to give this.

08:22.000 --> 08:25.000
After that we are giving an alternative name from here.

08:25.000 --> 08:26.000
When the image is not loaded.

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
Then it will show search.

08:28.000 --> 08:30.000
So we have done so much work.

08:30.000 --> 08:32.000
Now the second thing is.

08:32.000 --> 08:37.000
Now we want that when the user clicks on his search button at any time.

08:37.000 --> 08:38.000
Then the movie should be searched.

08:38.000 --> 08:41.000
So we will put an onclick method here.

08:41.000 --> 08:43.000
And in onclick we will make a callback function here.

08:44.000 --> 08:51.000
Which will do that when the user clicks on the search button.

08:51.000 --> 08:53.000
Then our function of search movies will be called.

08:53.000 --> 08:55.000
Which is the function of search movies?

08:55.000 --> 08:56.000
This one.

08:56.000 --> 08:58.000
Which we used while calling API.

08:58.000 --> 08:59.000
You must remember.

08:59.000 --> 09:02.000
When we locked the data in the console.

09:02.000 --> 09:06.000
Then we saw that the function of search movies was working.

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
So we called the function of search movies.

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
As soon as the user clicks on the search button.

09:10.000 --> 09:13.000
And in the search movies function we used a parameter.

09:13.000 --> 09:14.000
The name of the movie.

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
So where will the name of the movie come from?

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
The name of the movie will come from the search term.

09:18.000 --> 09:19.000
See this.

09:19.000 --> 09:21.000
Which the user had put in the input box.

09:21.000 --> 09:22.000
He had put the search term.

09:22.000 --> 09:23.000
See this.

09:23.000 --> 09:24.000
You must remember.

09:24.000 --> 09:25.000
So this search term.

09:25.000 --> 09:29.000
We have to put a parameter in it.

09:29.000 --> 09:32.000
Because it will search the search term.

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
Now after this.

09:34.000 --> 09:37.000
Let's go to the web page and check once.

09:37.000 --> 09:39.000
Is the movie being searched or not?

09:39.000 --> 09:41.000
So we go to the web page.

09:41.000 --> 09:42.000
Go to the web page.

09:43.000 --> 09:46.000
And here you must be able to see.

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
See our search button is also seen here.

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
See the search button has also come here.

09:50.000 --> 09:51.000
Now let's do one thing.

09:51.000 --> 09:55.000
Here we open our console.

09:55.000 --> 09:56.000
We open the console here.

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
Now our console is empty.

09:58.000 --> 09:59.000
Nothing in the console.

09:59.000 --> 10:01.000
Now here we search a movie.

10:01.000 --> 10:04.000
I search the name of the movie for example Iron Man here.

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
And I click it here.

10:06.000 --> 10:07.000
As soon as I clicked it.

10:07.000 --> 10:10.000
So the function of search movies was called.

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
And it locked the data in the console.

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
So see the search results have come.

10:14.000 --> 10:16.000
And here we have got 10 arrays.

10:16.000 --> 10:19.000
In this see the movies of Iron Man have come.

10:19.000 --> 10:20.000
Iron Man.

10:20.000 --> 10:21.000
Iron Man 3.

10:21.000 --> 10:22.000
Iron Man 2.

10:22.000 --> 10:23.000
So you are able to see.

10:23.000 --> 10:25.000
The whole search data is visible to us.

10:25.000 --> 10:29.000
So here we have successfully implemented the search in our code.
