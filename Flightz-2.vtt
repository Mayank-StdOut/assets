WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:06.000
Intro

00:06.000 --> 00:09.000
So now we will come to app.js

00:09.000 --> 00:11.000
and after coming to app.js

00:11.000 --> 00:14.000
first of all you have to remove logo.svg

00:14.000 --> 00:16.000
because we have deleted it

00:16.000 --> 00:18.000
so that we don't get any error

00:18.000 --> 00:20.000
after that the first thing we have to do is

00:20.000 --> 00:22.000
to setup the user form

00:22.000 --> 00:26.000
because the user will give the input through the form

00:26.000 --> 00:29.000
that from where he wants the flight

00:29.000 --> 00:31.000
for how many adults he wants

00:31.000 --> 00:32.000
in which date he wants

00:32.000 --> 00:34.000
so we have to make a form

00:34.000 --> 00:36.000
so for that we have to remove all these things

00:36.000 --> 00:38.000
which we have already given here

00:38.000 --> 00:40.000
so we have removed it

00:40.000 --> 00:42.000
and we will make a new div

00:42.000 --> 00:45.000
whose class name we will give app

00:45.000 --> 00:48.000
actually first of all we select the language

00:48.000 --> 00:52.000
and here we make a div whose class name we will give app

00:52.000 --> 00:55.000
and in this div the first thing that will go

00:55.000 --> 00:57.000
will be a main tag

00:57.000 --> 00:59.000
whose class name we will give content

00:59.000 --> 01:01.000
by doing content section

01:01.000 --> 01:03.000
by doing content section

01:03.000 --> 01:05.000
and in this what will go

01:05.000 --> 01:07.000
that will go our form

01:07.000 --> 01:11.000
so form is actually a lot of

01:11.000 --> 01:14.000
form making which is the html process

01:14.000 --> 01:17.000
there is no logic part involved in it

01:17.000 --> 01:20.000
in this part if any further logic part comes

01:20.000 --> 01:21.000
which will obviously come

01:21.000 --> 01:23.000
we will explain it well

01:23.000 --> 01:25.000
so what you have to do before that

01:25.000 --> 01:26.000
you have to go to code section

01:26.000 --> 01:27.000
from app.js

01:27.000 --> 01:29.000
you have to pick up this form thing

01:29.000 --> 01:31.000
from form bg

01:31.000 --> 01:34.000
you have to pick up this whole form

01:34.000 --> 01:36.000
after that your form

01:36.000 --> 01:38.000
comes here

01:38.000 --> 01:40.000
you have to save it

01:40.000 --> 01:41.000
so what happened here

01:41.000 --> 01:43.000
by using form bg class name

01:43.000 --> 01:45.000
we will give a background to the form

01:45.000 --> 01:47.000
in which we will put a photo of a flight

01:47.000 --> 01:49.000
there is a form in the form container

01:49.000 --> 01:50.000
in which there is a heading

01:50.000 --> 01:51.000
find the best flight fares

01:51.000 --> 01:52.000
is flight fares

01:52.000 --> 01:53.000
after this

01:53.000 --> 01:55.000
here our input tags are used

01:55.000 --> 01:57.000
in which we have taken from input

01:57.000 --> 01:58.000
to input

01:58.000 --> 02:00.000
we have taken date input

02:00.000 --> 02:02.000
we have taken number of adults input

02:02.000 --> 02:04.000
and we have taken seat type input

02:04.000 --> 02:06.000
so here we have used select tag

02:06.000 --> 02:08.000
and have given select options

02:08.000 --> 02:11.000
after this finally we have a submit button

02:11.000 --> 02:13.000
so we have used our submit button

02:13.000 --> 02:17.000
to submit the form

02:17.000 --> 02:19.000
now we have saved it

02:19.000 --> 02:21.000
now we will go to app.css

02:21.000 --> 02:23.000
in app.css

02:23.000 --> 02:26.000
the css will be given to you

02:26.000 --> 02:28.000
in code section

02:28.000 --> 02:30.000
so you have to pick up the css

02:30.000 --> 02:31.000
from there

02:31.000 --> 02:32.000
and you have to bring it here

02:32.000 --> 02:33.000
and paste it

02:33.000 --> 02:35.000
so I also copied the css from there

02:35.000 --> 02:38.000
and here I have pasted it

02:38.000 --> 02:40.000
now what we have given in this css

02:40.000 --> 02:41.000
form container

02:41.000 --> 02:43.000
in which our whole form is

02:43.000 --> 02:45.000
the background image of it

02:45.000 --> 02:46.000
will come here

02:46.000 --> 02:47.000
after this

02:47.000 --> 02:48.000
here

02:48.000 --> 02:50.000
the inputs

02:50.000 --> 02:52.000
we have given the display flex

02:52.000 --> 02:54.000
due to which line by line

02:54.000 --> 02:56.000
means all will come in a single line

02:56.000 --> 02:57.000
form head

02:57.000 --> 02:59.000
where the heading of the form is given

02:59.000 --> 03:00.000
we have given color

03:00.000 --> 03:02.000
we have given text align center

03:02.000 --> 03:03.000
after this

03:03.000 --> 03:04.000
here

03:04.000 --> 03:06.000
we have again given the form group

03:06.000 --> 03:07.000
by doing display flex

03:07.000 --> 03:08.000
after this

03:08.000 --> 03:09.000
all the things

03:09.000 --> 03:10.000
we have given here

03:10.000 --> 03:12.000
here we have given the input

03:12.000 --> 03:14.000
these styles

03:14.000 --> 03:16.000
where we have given the border radius of the input

03:16.000 --> 03:17.000
we have given font family

03:17.000 --> 03:19.000
we have made the submit button of this color

03:19.000 --> 03:22.000
so it is used for the whole classes and css

03:22.000 --> 03:24.000
now after this we do one thing

03:24.000 --> 03:26.000
now we go to our web browser

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
and check how our website is looking

03:28.000 --> 03:29.000
so here

03:29.000 --> 03:31.000
there are some things

03:31.000 --> 03:33.000
which are coming undefined

03:33.000 --> 03:34.000
there are some problems

03:34.000 --> 03:35.000
so actually what is there

03:35.000 --> 03:36.000
that your form

03:36.000 --> 03:37.000
in this

03:37.000 --> 03:39.000
the methods of on submit

03:39.000 --> 03:40.000
on submit

03:40.000 --> 03:41.000
this thing

03:41.000 --> 03:42.000
we will do further

03:42.000 --> 03:43.000
like handle input change

03:43.000 --> 03:44.000
and on submit

03:44.000 --> 03:45.000
so for this

03:45.000 --> 03:46.000
what we do

03:46.000 --> 03:47.000
first of all

03:47.000 --> 03:48.000
we make a function

03:48.000 --> 03:49.000
which will be an empty function

03:49.000 --> 03:51.000
because we have to do these things further

03:51.000 --> 03:52.000
so for this

03:52.000 --> 03:53.000
first of all we make functions

03:53.000 --> 03:54.000
so the first function

03:54.000 --> 03:55.000
which we will make

03:55.000 --> 03:56.000
we will make

03:56.000 --> 03:57.000
what name

03:57.000 --> 04:00.000
with handle submit name

04:00.000 --> 04:03.000
so we make a function with handle submit name

04:03.000 --> 04:06.000
and there will be a function of handle submit name

04:06.000 --> 04:08.000
there will be arrow function

04:08.000 --> 04:11.000
in which we will not put anything

04:11.000 --> 04:13.000
same thing will happen

04:13.000 --> 04:16.000
here we do console dot log

04:16.000 --> 04:17.000
we write

04:17.000 --> 04:20.000
we give an empty string

04:20.000 --> 04:21.000
after this

04:21.000 --> 04:22.000
the second function

04:22.000 --> 04:23.000
that we will make

04:23.000 --> 04:25.000
by changing handle input

04:25.000 --> 04:26.000
by changing handle input

04:26.000 --> 04:27.000
so by copying this

04:27.000 --> 04:28.000
its name is

04:28.000 --> 04:29.000
handle input change

04:29.000 --> 04:30.000
we give it

04:32.000 --> 04:33.000
so we are making the function

04:33.000 --> 04:35.000
so that we do not get errors

04:35.000 --> 04:36.000
because we will put this function

04:36.000 --> 04:37.000
further

04:37.000 --> 04:38.000
in this function

04:38.000 --> 04:39.000
things will be put

04:39.000 --> 04:40.000
by which

04:40.000 --> 04:41.000
the form will be submitted

04:41.000 --> 04:42.000
so the things which will be triggered

04:42.000 --> 04:43.000
they will be triggered

04:43.000 --> 04:44.000
on the same function

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
so we have made all these functions

04:46.000 --> 04:47.000
after this

04:47.000 --> 04:48.000
we go to our web browser again

04:48.000 --> 04:49.000
and check once

04:49.000 --> 04:51.000
so we are not getting any error here

04:51.000 --> 04:52.000
for now

04:52.000 --> 04:53.000
and you can see

04:53.000 --> 04:54.000
our form

04:54.000 --> 04:55.000
is ready

04:55.000 --> 04:56.000
so here

04:56.000 --> 04:57.000
user can select the form

04:57.000 --> 04:58.000
from where to where

04:58.000 --> 04:59.000
so for example

04:59.000 --> 05:00.000
form

05:00.000 --> 05:01.000
Bhopal to Delhi

05:01.000 --> 05:02.000
what is the date

05:02.000 --> 05:03.000
after this

05:03.000 --> 05:04.000
how many adults will be there

05:04.000 --> 05:05.000
so here

05:05.000 --> 05:06.000
they can be selected

05:06.000 --> 05:07.000
in economy

05:07.000 --> 05:08.000
he can select

05:08.000 --> 05:09.000
seat type

05:09.000 --> 05:10.000
and finally

05:10.000 --> 05:11.000
in find fields

05:11.000 --> 05:12.000
he can click

05:12.000 --> 05:13.000
and after form

05:13.000 --> 05:14.000
the process

05:14.000 --> 05:15.000
we will

05:15.000 --> 05:16.000
do further

05:16.000 --> 05:17.000
that how

05:17.000 --> 05:18.000
user will get

05:18.000 --> 05:19.000
flight details

05:24.000 --> 05:25.000
we can schedule

05:25.000 --> 05:26.000
friends

05:26.000 --> 05:27.000
for talking

05:27.000 --> 05:28.000
and

05:28.000 --> 05:29.000
next

05:29.000 --> 05:30.000
time

05:30.000 --> 05:31.000
we will

05:31.000 --> 05:32.000
check

05:32.000 --> 05:33.000
here

05:33.000 --> 05:34.000
that

05:34.000 --> 05:35.000
best

05:35.000 --> 05:36.000
switching

05:36.000 --> 05:37.000
they showed

05:37.000 --> 05:38.000
light

05:38.000 --> 05:39.000
we look

05:39.000 --> 05:40.000
we all

05:40.000 --> 05:43.000
come

05:43.000 --> 05:44.000
here

05:44.000 --> 05:53.000
for
