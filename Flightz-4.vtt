00:06.000 --> 00:10.000
So now we will create a component in which we will show the data of flights.

00:10.000 --> 00:13.000
For that you have to go to the source folder and click on it.

00:13.000 --> 00:16.000
And you have to create a new folder named components.

00:16.000 --> 00:19.000
You will create a folder named component.

00:19.000 --> 00:24.000
In this you have to create a file in which we will show the data.

00:24.000 --> 00:30.000
You have to make a component by listing flights.

00:30.000 --> 00:34.000
And in this you have to type rafce.

00:34.000 --> 00:39.000
By which the basic boilerplate code i.e. the basic body is generated.

00:39.000 --> 00:44.000
After this the first thing we have to do is to show the same data we have to use divs.

00:44.000 --> 00:47.000
Now we have to use the basic JSX.

00:47.000 --> 00:50.000
So on that we don't waste our time.

00:50.000 --> 00:53.000
What we do is that by going to the code section.

00:53.000 --> 00:58.000
We will paste the basic code in which we set the whole data.

00:58.000 --> 01:01.000
So we will paste this code here.

01:01.000 --> 01:03.000
I will explain it to you properly.

01:03.000 --> 01:05.000
So basically what is here?

01:05.000 --> 01:09.000
The first thing is that we have created a class named list.

01:09.000 --> 01:12.000
In which there is another div named flight box.

01:12.000 --> 01:16.000
In this what we will do is that everything will be shown in the flight box.

01:16.000 --> 01:22.000
And this list we have given the name of the particular box.

01:22.000 --> 01:23.000
Which you have just seen.

01:23.000 --> 01:28.000
So we have given the name of the entire container.

01:28.000 --> 01:31.000
In this the first thing that will be shown to you is the plane tail.

01:31.000 --> 01:33.000
That will be shown to you from this image.

01:33.000 --> 01:35.000
The image link that is given.

01:35.000 --> 01:37.000
The plane tail that you see in the image.

01:37.000 --> 01:39.000
It comes from here.

01:39.000 --> 01:42.000
After this you will see the name of the flight here.

01:42.000 --> 01:44.000
Now see here we have used this.

01:44.000 --> 01:45.000
So how will it be?

01:45.000 --> 01:46.000
By using props.

01:46.000 --> 01:49.000
So we will use props to bring flight data from another file.

01:49.000 --> 01:51.000
The same thing is here.

01:51.000 --> 01:52.000
Flight box.

01:52.000 --> 01:57.000
We have put airport info and departure info in another class.

01:57.000 --> 01:59.000
For which we will use flights data again.

01:59.000 --> 02:01.000
By using departure time.

02:01.000 --> 02:04.000
And we will put departure airport code.

02:04.000 --> 02:06.000
From where we are taking all this data?

02:06.000 --> 02:07.000
We are taking from APS.

02:07.000 --> 02:10.000
After taking from APS we are bringing through props here.

02:10.000 --> 02:15.000
And in it some properties of departure and time we are taking from here.

02:15.000 --> 02:18.000
So basically we are taking data from there.

02:18.000 --> 02:20.000
Here the same thing is here.

02:20.000 --> 02:21.000
Arrival city.

02:21.000 --> 02:22.000
Arrival date.

02:22.000 --> 02:24.000
Now in the end we have said price.

02:24.000 --> 02:25.000
So what is price?

02:25.000 --> 02:27.000
Here price is given in the form of decimal.

02:27.000 --> 02:29.000
Price is given in the form of decimal.

02:29.000 --> 02:32.000
It is given in the form of a float.

02:32.000 --> 02:35.000
So now we will convert that decimal in the form of integer.

02:35.000 --> 02:38.000
So we have converted this function by using this function.

02:38.000 --> 02:41.000
So basically we have not done it directly in the form of integer.

02:41.000 --> 02:44.000
We have taken its lower limit value.

02:44.000 --> 02:48.000
For example if the value is given as 1.9.

02:48.000 --> 02:49.000
1.9.

02:49.000 --> 02:50.000
So if I say its seal value.

02:50.000 --> 02:53.000
If we use math.seal function.

02:53.000 --> 02:55.000
So its upper value is 2.

02:55.000 --> 02:57.000
Its lower value is 1.

02:57.000 --> 02:58.000
So it is the same.

02:58.000 --> 03:02.000
If there is any integer value in it then it will give its lower value.

03:02.000 --> 03:05.000
Means it will give the lower value of any decimal value.

03:05.000 --> 03:08.000
For example if there is a flight fare.

03:08.000 --> 03:14.000
12000 rupees and 55 paise for example.

03:14.000 --> 03:17.000
So it will give you 12000 rupees.

03:17.000 --> 03:19.000
So here the user will see the amount.

03:19.000 --> 03:21.000
By using this.

03:21.000 --> 03:22.000
Ok.

03:22.000 --> 03:24.000
So finally this is our flight list.

03:24.000 --> 03:27.000
Now by using props we have to get the flight data first.

03:27.000 --> 03:29.000
From where we have to get the flight data?

03:29.000 --> 03:32.000
From our main app.js.

03:32.000 --> 03:34.000
From that we have to get the flight data.

03:34.000 --> 03:38.000
So now first of all we will go to app.js.

03:38.000 --> 03:40.000
And by going to app.js.

03:40.000 --> 03:42.000
We will call this component first.

03:42.000 --> 03:44.000
For that what we have to do.

03:44.000 --> 03:45.000
You must remember.

03:45.000 --> 03:47.000
That first we check this.

03:47.000 --> 03:48.000
That in our flight data.

03:48.000 --> 03:50.000
Is there any data in our flight data.

03:50.000 --> 03:53.000
Means is our api returning any data or not.

03:53.000 --> 03:55.000
If data is not returning then what we will show.

03:55.000 --> 03:57.000
No data found.

03:57.000 --> 03:58.000
Ok.

03:58.000 --> 04:02.000
And if it is returning then only we will show that component.

04:02.000 --> 04:04.000
So for that what we do.

04:04.000 --> 04:05.000
Here.

04:05.000 --> 04:06.000
Where our form ends.

04:06.000 --> 04:08.000
Almost here.

04:08.000 --> 04:11.000
Here first we put a condition.

04:11.000 --> 04:13.000
What is that condition.

04:13.000 --> 04:15.000
Flights data.

04:15.000 --> 04:17.000
Dot length.

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
Flights data.

04:20.000 --> 04:21.000
Dot length.

04:21.000 --> 04:23.000
If it is more than zero.

04:23.000 --> 04:24.000
Means.

04:24.000 --> 04:26.000
If there is any data in it.

04:26.000 --> 04:28.000
Then what it will show.

04:28.000 --> 04:32.000
Then it will show us the component of flights list.

04:32.000 --> 04:37.000
So here we are getting the component of flights list.

04:37.000 --> 04:38.000
So as soon as we do this.

04:38.000 --> 04:42.000
So see at the top our component is also imported.

04:42.000 --> 04:43.000
See this.

04:43.000 --> 04:45.000
Flight list component is imported.

04:45.000 --> 04:47.000
Now after this.

04:48.000 --> 04:50.000
Second thing.

04:50.000 --> 04:51.000
After doing this.

04:51.000 --> 04:52.000
What we have to put here.

04:52.000 --> 04:53.000
Else condition.

04:53.000 --> 04:54.000
What should happen in else condition.

04:54.000 --> 04:57.000
In else condition you should see this basic text.

04:57.000 --> 04:58.000
Which is.

04:58.000 --> 05:00.000
Which I will show you here.

05:00.000 --> 05:01.000
What is this.

05:01.000 --> 05:03.000
Something like this should be seen.

05:03.000 --> 05:05.000
Now you can directly see it and code it.

05:05.000 --> 05:07.000
That a div tag will be seen.

05:07.000 --> 05:09.000
In which no data will be available.

05:09.000 --> 05:11.000
We have given something like this style.

05:11.000 --> 05:12.000
Text align center.

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
Center text align will be.

05:14.000 --> 05:16.000
And its margin which will be given from the top.

05:16.000 --> 05:17.000
Will be of 75 pixels.

05:17.000 --> 05:19.000
After this.

05:19.000 --> 05:22.000
Now we have to send data in flight list.

05:22.000 --> 05:25.000
But we are getting list of data from API.

05:25.000 --> 05:26.000
We are getting arrays.

05:26.000 --> 05:28.000
So now what we have to use here.

05:28.000 --> 05:29.000
Map function.

05:29.000 --> 05:31.000
What we will do by using map function.

05:31.000 --> 05:33.000
Whatever is the data of our flight.

05:33.000 --> 05:35.000
We will take that here.

05:35.000 --> 05:37.000
So now the map function.

05:37.000 --> 05:40.000
You have to write something like this.

05:40.000 --> 05:42.000
Here your map function.

05:42.000 --> 05:44.000
You will write something like this.

05:44.000 --> 05:45.000
Which I had already copied.

05:45.000 --> 05:46.000
But.

05:46.000 --> 05:48.000
I will explain it to you once.

05:48.000 --> 05:49.000
What we have done.

05:49.000 --> 05:50.000
We have made a div.

05:50.000 --> 05:52.000
In div we have given a class name.

05:52.000 --> 05:53.000
All flights name.

05:53.000 --> 05:54.000
In this.

05:54.000 --> 05:55.000
What we have done here.

05:55.000 --> 05:57.000
Means whatever the flight list will be.

05:57.000 --> 05:58.000
Flight list.

05:58.000 --> 06:00.000
Basically that whole component.

06:00.000 --> 06:01.000
We have given a name.

06:01.000 --> 06:03.000
Means we have given a class.

06:03.000 --> 06:04.000
By doing all flights.

06:04.000 --> 06:05.000
Ok.

06:05.000 --> 06:06.000
And what is flight data.

06:06.000 --> 06:07.000
Flight data.

06:07.000 --> 06:09.000
Where our flight data was being saved.

06:09.000 --> 06:10.000
Means this state.

06:10.000 --> 06:11.000
Top one.

06:11.000 --> 06:12.000
Here.

06:12.000 --> 06:13.000
So what we are doing.

06:13.000 --> 06:14.000
We are mapping the flight data completely.

06:14.000 --> 06:15.000
From there.

06:15.000 --> 06:16.000
From there.

06:16.000 --> 06:17.000
We are taking out the data of each flight.

06:17.000 --> 06:18.000
So we will give its name.

06:18.000 --> 06:19.000
Flight data.

06:19.000 --> 06:20.000
Then after that.

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
We have written the component of the flight list.

06:22.000 --> 06:24.000
That we have written here.

06:24.000 --> 06:25.000
After this.

06:25.000 --> 06:26.000
We will give that component.

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
Whatever data is going in it.

06:28.000 --> 06:29.000
We will give it a key.

06:29.000 --> 06:31.000
We will give a key to every data.

06:31.000 --> 06:33.000
What is the key basically.

06:33.000 --> 06:34.000
Let's understand this.

06:34.000 --> 06:35.000
See.

06:35.000 --> 06:37.000
Here there is a list of data.

06:37.000 --> 06:40.000
There is a lot of data in the whole flight data.

06:40.000 --> 06:41.000
So now.

06:41.000 --> 06:44.000
How will our code recognize every data uniquely.

06:44.000 --> 06:47.000
So we have to give a name to every data.

06:47.000 --> 06:49.000
We have given the flight data here.

06:49.000 --> 06:51.000
We have given the flight data.

06:51.000 --> 06:53.000
But basically what we are saying is.

06:53.000 --> 06:55.000
That all the data inside it.

06:55.000 --> 06:57.000
We are calling them flight data.

06:57.000 --> 06:59.000
But the basic data.

06:59.000 --> 07:01.000
In which you have information about the airport.

07:01.000 --> 07:03.000
Information about the flight.

07:03.000 --> 07:05.000
So it is necessary to identify it uniquely.

07:05.000 --> 07:07.000
In the map function.

07:07.000 --> 07:09.000
If your data is very big.

07:09.000 --> 07:11.000
So you use the key keyword here.

07:11.000 --> 07:13.000
And you use here.

07:13.000 --> 07:14.000
Means.

07:14.000 --> 07:15.000
If you do.

07:15.000 --> 07:16.000
It is a good practice.

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
You should use it in the map function.

07:18.000 --> 07:20.000
So the data named flight data.

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
There is a parameter named id in it.

07:22.000 --> 07:25.000
You have to give it here.

07:25.000 --> 07:27.000
So the key will be ours.

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
Now flight data dot id will be.

07:29.000 --> 07:30.000
The id of every flight.

07:30.000 --> 07:32.000
That will be our unique value.

07:32.000 --> 07:34.000
Which will represent it.

07:34.000 --> 07:35.000
This is the main thing.

07:35.000 --> 07:36.000
After this.

07:36.000 --> 07:37.000
What are we doing here.

07:37.000 --> 07:38.000
Using props.

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
We are sending the flight data here.

07:40.000 --> 07:42.000
In this component.

07:42.000 --> 07:43.000
Okay.

07:43.000 --> 07:44.000
Diff is closing.

07:44.000 --> 07:46.000
And here is our else condition.

07:46.000 --> 07:47.000
Okay.

07:47.000 --> 07:48.000
So what will we do now.

07:48.000 --> 07:50.000
Now we have sent the data here.

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
Now what we have to do is.

07:52.000 --> 07:53.000
In our flight list.

07:53.000 --> 07:55.000
We have to take it.

07:55.000 --> 07:57.000
We have to call it.

07:57.000 --> 07:59.000
We have to receive the prop here.

07:59.000 --> 08:00.000
So what will we do.

08:00.000 --> 08:01.000
By doing this.

08:01.000 --> 08:03.000
Here we will write flight data.

08:03.000 --> 08:05.000
Flight data.

08:05.000 --> 08:06.000
This is it.

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
So flight data basically we have.

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
Received from there.

08:10.000 --> 08:12.000
Now all these things in this flight data.

08:12.000 --> 08:13.000
All these things.

08:13.000 --> 08:14.000
The name of the flight.

08:14.000 --> 08:15.000
I had shown you.

08:15.000 --> 08:16.000
By calling API.

08:16.000 --> 08:17.000
What all data you are getting.

08:17.000 --> 08:19.000
So from that flight name was also getting.

08:19.000 --> 08:21.000
And in this what you are getting.

08:21.000 --> 08:22.000
In flight data.

08:22.000 --> 08:25.000
You are getting departure airport info.

08:25.000 --> 08:28.000
After this you are getting all these things.

08:28.000 --> 08:29.000
Now some things are there.

08:29.000 --> 08:31.000
Like departure time.

08:31.000 --> 08:32.000
So our API.

08:32.000 --> 08:33.000
Is not giving us a time.

08:33.000 --> 08:35.000
It is giving us the full date.

08:35.000 --> 08:37.000
So we have to get the time from that date.

08:37.000 --> 08:39.000
We have to get the time info.

08:39.000 --> 08:41.000
For arrival as well as departure.

08:41.000 --> 08:43.000
So we have to do this manually.

08:43.000 --> 08:45.000
So for this we have to.

08:45.000 --> 08:46.000
To extract from ourselves.

08:46.000 --> 08:47.000
We have to write logic from ourselves.

08:47.000 --> 08:49.000
So what will we do for that.

08:49.000 --> 08:51.000
So first of all what we will do.

08:51.000 --> 08:53.000
Here we will make one.

08:53.000 --> 08:54.000
Object.

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
In which we will first.

08:56.000 --> 08:57.000
The extracted date.

08:57.000 --> 08:58.000
Or sorry.

08:58.000 --> 09:00.000
The extracted time from ourselves.

09:00.000 --> 09:01.000
We will store that.

09:01.000 --> 09:02.000
Then we will use it here.

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
Like we have used here.

09:04.000 --> 09:05.000
By calling date time info.

09:05.000 --> 09:06.000
We have made an object.

09:06.000 --> 09:07.000
In that departure.

09:07.000 --> 09:08.000
Is time.

09:08.000 --> 09:09.000
We are using that.

09:09.000 --> 09:10.000
Okay.

09:10.000 --> 09:11.000
So.

09:11.000 --> 09:12.000
We will make here.

09:12.000 --> 09:15.000
And this is our basic.

09:15.000 --> 09:17.000
Now what we will do here.

09:17.000 --> 09:18.000
In this object.

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
We will go to two more objects.

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
First object will go for departure.

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
In this we will store departure time.

09:24.000 --> 09:25.000
And.

09:25.000 --> 09:27.000
In this what we will store first.

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
In departure we will have.

09:29.000 --> 09:30.000
Date.

09:30.000 --> 09:31.000
First it will be date.

09:31.000 --> 09:32.000
That departure date will be.

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
What will happen for departure date.

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
That our flight data.

09:36.000 --> 09:37.000
Which we are getting.

09:37.000 --> 09:38.000
In that.

09:38.000 --> 09:39.000
There is a departure.

09:39.000 --> 09:40.000
Airport.

09:40.000 --> 09:41.000
In that.

09:41.000 --> 09:42.000
By doing airport.

09:42.000 --> 09:43.000
By doing departure airport.

09:43.000 --> 09:44.000
There is our.

09:44.000 --> 09:45.000
Parameter.

09:45.000 --> 09:46.000
Okay.

09:46.000 --> 09:47.000
That departure airport.

09:47.000 --> 09:48.000
Which.

09:48.000 --> 09:49.000
Value is.

09:49.000 --> 09:50.000
Key is.

09:50.000 --> 09:51.000
Sorry.

09:51.000 --> 09:52.000
By doing departure airport.

09:52.000 --> 09:53.000
Our key is.

09:53.000 --> 09:54.000
In that.

09:54.000 --> 09:55.000
By doing time.

09:55.000 --> 09:56.000
What is this?

09:56.000 --> 09:57.000
There is another key.

09:57.000 --> 09:58.000
By doing departure airport.

09:58.000 --> 09:59.000
There is an object.

09:59.000 --> 10:00.000
In that.

10:00.000 --> 10:01.000
By doing time.

10:01.000 --> 10:02.000
There is a key.

10:02.000 --> 10:03.000
We will do that.

10:03.000 --> 10:04.000
By using dot split.

10:04.000 --> 10:05.000
Now in that time.

10:05.000 --> 10:06.000
In that time.

10:06.000 --> 10:07.000
What you have given.

10:07.000 --> 10:08.000
The complete format.

10:08.000 --> 10:09.000
That is.

10:09.000 --> 10:10.000
You have given.

10:10.000 --> 10:11.000
The complete format.

10:11.000 --> 10:12.000
So.

10:12.000 --> 10:13.000
Here.

10:13.000 --> 10:14.000
The photo is also coming.

10:14.000 --> 10:15.000
So.

10:15.000 --> 10:16.000
You will be able to see.

10:16.000 --> 10:17.000
What kind of object is that.

10:17.000 --> 10:18.000
So.

10:18.000 --> 10:19.000
What we have to do with that.

10:19.000 --> 10:20.000
First of all.

10:20.000 --> 10:21.000
We have to split.

10:21.000 --> 10:22.000
So.

10:22.000 --> 10:23.000
First of all.

10:23.000 --> 10:24.000
We have to divide it.

10:24.000 --> 10:25.000
From the middle.

10:25.000 --> 10:26.000
So.

10:26.000 --> 10:27.000
Wherever.

10:27.000 --> 10:28.000
He will see.

10:28.000 --> 10:29.000
T in that string.

10:29.000 --> 10:30.000
So.

10:30.000 --> 10:31.000
He will.

10:31.000 --> 10:32.000
Divide that string.

10:32.000 --> 10:33.000
For example.

10:33.000 --> 10:34.000
Your name.

10:34.000 --> 10:35.000
If.

10:35.000 --> 10:36.000
For example.

10:36.000 --> 10:37.000
Let's.

10:37.000 --> 10:38.000
Take a word.

10:38.000 --> 10:39.000
Maths.

10:39.000 --> 10:40.000
So.

10:40.000 --> 10:41.000
If we.

10:41.000 --> 10:42.000
If we run this thing in math.

10:42.000 --> 10:43.000
So.

10:43.000 --> 10:44.000
What would happen.

10:44.000 --> 10:45.000
He would have separated the things before t.

10:45.000 --> 10:46.000
And.

10:46.000 --> 10:47.000
Separate the things after t.

10:47.000 --> 10:48.000
Same.

10:48.000 --> 10:49.000
Departure.

10:49.000 --> 10:50.000
For the time.

10:50.000 --> 10:51.000
If.

10:51.000 --> 10:52.000
He.

10:52.000 --> 10:53.000
In this time.

10:53.000 --> 10:54.000
If.

10:54.000 --> 10:55.000
T string is found.

10:55.000 --> 10:56.000
Which.

10:56.000 --> 10:57.000
Will be found everywhere.

10:57.000 --> 10:58.000
So.

10:58.000 --> 10:59.000
He will divide it into two parts.

10:59.000 --> 11:00.000
And.

11:00.000 --> 11:01.000
Here.

11:01.000 --> 11:02.000
The part before t.

11:02.000 --> 11:03.000
That.

11:03.000 --> 11:04.000
Gives us date.

11:04.000 --> 11:05.000
So.

11:05.000 --> 11:06.000
We will write zero here.

11:06.000 --> 11:07.000
So.

11:07.000 --> 11:08.000
We will capture the part before t.

11:08.000 --> 11:09.000
And.

11:09.000 --> 11:10.000
Date.

11:10.000 --> 11:11.000
Now.

11:11.000 --> 11:12.000
We have to do the same thing for the time.

11:12.000 --> 11:13.000
The time.

11:13.000 --> 11:14.000
That.

11:14.000 --> 11:15.000
Is in the string after it.

11:15.000 --> 11:16.000
So.

11:16.000 --> 11:17.000
What will we do for the time.

11:17.000 --> 11:18.000
For the time.

11:18.000 --> 11:19.000
We will do this thing here.

11:19.000 --> 11:20.000
That is.

11:20.000 --> 11:21.000
For the time.

11:21.000 --> 11:22.000
From the flight data.

11:22.000 --> 11:23.000
In departure.

11:23.000 --> 11:24.000
In the airport.

11:24.000 --> 11:25.000
With the value of time.

11:25.000 --> 11:26.000
And.

11:26.000 --> 11:27.000
Key.

11:27.000 --> 11:28.000
We will split it first.

11:28.000 --> 11:29.000
Like.

11:29.000 --> 11:30.000
It was above.

11:30.000 --> 11:31.000
Here.

11:31.000 --> 11:32.000
We took the first.

11:32.000 --> 11:33.000
Data before t.

11:33.000 --> 11:34.000
Here.

11:34.000 --> 11:35.000
We will take the data after t.

11:35.000 --> 11:36.000
And.

11:36.000 --> 11:37.000
From it.

11:37.000 --> 11:38.000
We will take the values.

11:38.000 --> 11:39.000
That is.

11:39.000 --> 11:40.000
For example.

11:40.000 --> 11:41.000
Here.

11:41.000 --> 11:42.000
I will tell you by commenting.

11:42.000 --> 11:43.000
Like.

11:43.000 --> 11:44.000
It was.

11:44.000 --> 11:45.000
Flight.

11:45.000 --> 11:46.000
For example.

11:46.000 --> 11:47.000
Flight.

11:47.000 --> 11:48.000
Flight.

11:48.000 --> 11:49.000
And.

11:49.000 --> 11:50.000
S.

11:50.000 --> 11:51.000
I will do it.

11:51.000 --> 11:52.000
Later.

11:52.000 --> 11:53.000
Now.

11:53.000 --> 11:54.000
What happens is.

11:54.000 --> 11:55.000
That.

11:55.000 --> 11:56.000
If I say.

11:56.000 --> 11:57.000
That.

11:57.000 --> 11:58.000
You.

11:58.000 --> 11:59.000
Here.

11:59.000 --> 12:00.000
It has only.

12:00.000 --> 12:01.000
Five values.

12:01.000 --> 12:02.000
To give.

12:02.000 --> 12:03.000
From it.

12:03.000 --> 12:04.000
Only five words.

12:04.000 --> 12:05.000
To pick up.

12:05.000 --> 12:06.000
So.

12:06.000 --> 12:07.000
Now.

12:07.000 --> 12:08.000
How many.

12:08.000 --> 12:09.000
Words.

12:09.000 --> 12:10.000
Will pick up.

12:10.000 --> 12:11.000
Same.

12:11.000 --> 12:12.000
Thing.

12:12.000 --> 12:13.000
In.

12:13.000 --> 12:14.000
Programming.

12:14.000 --> 12:15.000
Is.

12:15.000 --> 12:16.000
Zero.

12:16.000 --> 12:17.000
You.

12:17.000 --> 12:18.000
Tell.

12:18.000 --> 12:19.000
That.

12:19.000 --> 12:20.000
Means.

12:20.000 --> 12:21.000
This.

12:21.000 --> 12:22.000
First.

12:22.000 --> 12:23.000
Thing.

12:23.000 --> 12:24.000
That.

12:24.000 --> 12:25.000
Is.

12:25.000 --> 12:26.000
F.

12:26.000 --> 12:27.000
Is.

12:27.000 --> 12:28.000
Your.

12:28.000 --> 12:29.000
Zero.

12:29.000 --> 12:30.000
Index.

12:30.000 --> 12:31.000
And.

12:31.000 --> 12:32.000
This.

12:32.000 --> 12:33.000
Is.

12:33.000 --> 12:34.000
Your.

12:34.000 --> 12:35.000
Last.

12:35.000 --> 12:36.000
Index.

12:36.000 --> 12:37.000
Now.

12:37.000 --> 12:38.000
For.

12:38.000 --> 12:39.000
Your.

12:39.000 --> 12:40.000
Data.

12:40.000 --> 12:41.000
Because.

12:41.000 --> 12:42.000
You.

12:42.000 --> 12:43.000
Have.

12:43.000 --> 12:44.000
It.

12:44.000 --> 12:45.000
In.

12:45.000 --> 12:46.000
Your.

12:46.000 --> 12:47.000
Data.

12:47.000 --> 12:48.000
In.

12:48.000 --> 12:49.000
Your.

12:49.000 --> 12:50.000
Data.

12:50.000 --> 12:51.000
And.

12:51.000 --> 12:52.000
Your.

12:52.000 --> 12:53.000
Data.

12:53.000 --> 12:54.000
Is.

12:54.000 --> 12:55.000
Your.

12:55.000 --> 12:56.000
Index.

12:56.000 --> 12:57.000
And.

12:57.000 --> 12:58.000
You.

12:58.000 --> 12:59.000
Have.

12:59.000 --> 13:00.000
All.

13:00.000 --> 13:01.000
Your.

13:01.000 --> 13:02.000
Data.

13:02.000 --> 13:03.000
In.

13:03.000 --> 13:04.000
Your.

13:04.000 --> 13:05.000
Time.

13:05.000 --> 13:07.000
so it will be our time

13:07.000 --> 13:09.000
ok

13:09.000 --> 13:11.000
so you understood

13:11.000 --> 13:13.000
after this we have taken

13:13.000 --> 13:15.000
date time for departure

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
now second thing we need is for arrival

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
so here we will write arrival

13:19.000 --> 13:21.000
and the method of taking date time for arrival

13:21.000 --> 13:23.000
is same

13:23.000 --> 13:25.000
you have to do same thing

13:25.000 --> 13:27.000
and you will get the date time of arrival

13:27.000 --> 13:29.000
in same way

13:29.000 --> 13:31.000
so for arrival

13:31.000 --> 13:33.000
you have to

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
extract the data

13:35.000 --> 13:37.000
like this

13:37.000 --> 13:39.000
then you have taken date

13:39.000 --> 13:41.000
arrival.time

13:41.000 --> 13:43.000
and same thing

13:43.000 --> 13:45.000
ok

13:45.000 --> 13:47.000
so now what we have done

13:47.000 --> 13:49.000
we have taken all the data

13:49.000 --> 13:51.000
through props

13:51.000 --> 13:53.000
and date time info

13:53.000 --> 13:55.000
sorry i have written date time info

13:55.000 --> 13:57.000
so we have taken

13:57.000 --> 13:59.000
date time info

13:59.000 --> 14:01.000
now we have complete data

14:01.000 --> 14:03.000
so now

14:03.000 --> 14:05.000
we will check it

14:05.000 --> 14:07.000
on website

14:07.000 --> 14:09.000
first we will check terminal

14:09.000 --> 14:11.000
there is no error in this

14:11.000 --> 14:13.000
and now we will

14:13.000 --> 14:15.000
go to chrome

14:15.000 --> 14:17.000
and check

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
so see this

14:19.000 --> 14:21.000
now you must be seeing

14:21.000 --> 14:23.000
that how much business

14:23.000 --> 14:25.000
is going on

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
but you have to notice

14:27.000 --> 14:29.000
that the data of delhi to

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
bombay that we have searched

14:31.000 --> 14:33.000
is coming to us

14:33.000 --> 14:35.000
so one minute

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
i will show you

14:37.000 --> 14:39.000
select a particular element

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
from this

14:41.000 --> 14:43.000
these are different divs

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
so see it is telling you the name of the flight

14:45.000 --> 14:47.000
from delhi it will go 20 hours

14:47.000 --> 14:49.000
means 8 o'clock

14:49.000 --> 14:51.000
and it will go to this date

14:51.000 --> 14:53.000
ok

14:53.000 --> 14:55.000
city name is new delhi

14:55.000 --> 14:57.000
and after this

14:57.000 --> 14:59.000
how many hours flight will be

14:59.000 --> 15:01.000
how many stops will be

15:01.000 --> 15:03.000
and till where it will go

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
so all these things

15:05.000 --> 15:07.000
you have got here

15:07.000 --> 15:09.000
now you just have to

15:09.000 --> 15:11.000
give this thing style

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
means you have to make it better

15:13.000 --> 15:15.000
so that it looks good

15:15.000 --> 15:17.000
and now we will try one more thing

15:17.000 --> 15:19.000
if we put some other data here

15:19.000 --> 15:21.000
delhi to bombay

15:21.000 --> 15:23.000
and we put date of day

15:23.000 --> 15:25.000
means old date

15:25.000 --> 15:27.000
and now we will search

15:27.000 --> 15:29.000
so now what data is showing us

15:29.000 --> 15:31.000
we will see it once

15:31.000 --> 15:33.000
it is coming because

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
we have searched old date

15:35.000 --> 15:37.000
and we can't find old date flight

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
and data is available

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
that's why it is showing here

15:41.000 --> 15:43.000
but if we put here

15:43.000 --> 15:45.000
date of day

15:45.000 --> 15:47.000
and change city to delhi

15:47.000 --> 15:49.000
and bombay to bhopal

15:49.000 --> 15:51.000
and then

15:51.000 --> 15:53.000
after this

15:53.000 --> 15:55.000
we do economic class

15:55.000 --> 15:57.000
and then do find fares

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
so it takes some time

15:59.000 --> 16:01.000
to search this api data

16:01.000 --> 16:03.000
and see here

16:03.000 --> 16:05.000
all the info of flights

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
so here it is showing 2 flights

16:07.000 --> 16:09.000
in 2 passenger's economy

16:09.000 --> 16:11.000
and date is of today only

16:11.000 --> 16:13.000
and for today 2 flights are available

16:13.000 --> 16:15.000
and see the whole amount is shown

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
that how much is the ticket price

16:17.000 --> 16:19.000
now we just have to

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
style it

16:21.000 --> 16:23.000
so what we will do

16:23.000 --> 16:25.000
here we have to style it

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
so first of all

16:27.000 --> 16:29.000
we will go to

16:29.000 --> 16:31.000
vscode

16:31.000 --> 16:33.000
and here in components

16:33.000 --> 16:35.000
we have to make a folder

16:35.000 --> 16:37.000
named css

16:37.000 --> 16:39.000
in which we will put css of our components

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
ok

16:41.000 --> 16:43.000
so with this we can organize our code

16:43.000 --> 16:45.000
we made components

16:45.000 --> 16:47.000
in components we put flight name component

16:47.000 --> 16:49.000
in that we made css name folder

16:49.000 --> 16:51.000
and in this we will put css

16:51.000 --> 16:53.000
css of flight list css

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
for that we will create a new file

16:55.000 --> 16:57.000
we will name it

16:57.000 --> 16:59.000
flight

16:59.000 --> 17:01.000
list

17:01.000 --> 17:03.000
dot css

17:03.000 --> 17:05.000
dot css

17:05.000 --> 17:07.000
enter

17:07.000 --> 17:09.000
and same thing

17:09.000 --> 17:11.000
you will also get css in code section

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
you don't need css from there

17:13.000 --> 17:15.000
simply copy it

17:15.000 --> 17:17.000
so this is your css

17:17.000 --> 17:19.000
where we have given the background color

17:19.000 --> 17:21.000
as white

17:21.000 --> 17:23.000
so you can see the list

17:23.000 --> 17:25.000
background will be white

17:25.000 --> 17:27.000
we have given box shadow

17:27.000 --> 17:29.000
box shadow means

17:29.000 --> 17:31.000
the color around the box

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
how much gap from top to bottom

17:33.000 --> 17:35.000
height

17:35.000 --> 17:37.000
and same thing we have given here

17:37.000 --> 17:39.000
like you have used this color for price

17:39.000 --> 17:41.000
same all things

17:41.000 --> 17:43.000
so this is very basic css

17:43.000 --> 17:45.000
now once again

17:45.000 --> 17:47.000
we check it once

17:47.000 --> 17:49.000
first we see in terminal

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
there is no error

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
and now we check it

17:53.000 --> 17:55.000
so for now

17:55.000 --> 17:57.000
it is looking like this

17:57.000 --> 17:59.000
we will reload it

17:59.000 --> 18:01.000
reload it

18:01.000 --> 18:03.000
after that

18:03.000 --> 18:05.000
we do this

18:05.000 --> 18:07.000
before that

18:07.000 --> 18:09.000
one more thing

18:09.000 --> 18:11.000
which i am forgetting

18:11.000 --> 18:13.000
is to import css

18:13.000 --> 18:15.000
so we will import css

18:15.000 --> 18:17.000
so we will go here

18:17.000 --> 18:19.000
and first of all

18:19.000 --> 18:21.000
we will go to flightlist.jsx

18:21.000 --> 18:23.000
and import css

18:23.000 --> 18:25.000
so import

18:25.000 --> 18:27.000
and here we will go to css

18:27.000 --> 18:29.000
what we will do in css

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
which

18:31.000 --> 18:33.000
flightlist.css

18:33.000 --> 18:35.000
.css

18:35.000 --> 18:37.000
we have imported it

18:37.000 --> 18:39.000
in terminal we will see

18:39.000 --> 18:41.000
if there is any error

18:41.000 --> 18:43.000
now what is the error

18:43.000 --> 18:45.000
cannot resolve this

18:45.000 --> 18:47.000
so this means

18:47.000 --> 18:49.000
that this flightlist.css

18:49.000 --> 18:51.000
is not available

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
because we have given wrong path

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
once we check

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
path is still wrong

18:57.000 --> 18:59.000
ok

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
flightlist.css

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
ok ok

19:03.000 --> 19:05.000
so what is the problem

19:05.000 --> 19:07.000
i will tell you once

19:07.000 --> 19:09.000
the problem is that here it is called flightlist

19:09.000 --> 19:11.000
ok

19:11.000 --> 19:13.000
now let's see once

19:13.000 --> 19:15.000
now there should be no error

19:15.000 --> 19:17.000
and there is no error

19:17.000 --> 19:19.000
we go back

19:19.000 --> 19:21.000
and now we search

19:21.000 --> 19:23.000
and we enter the date

19:23.000 --> 19:25.000
29

19:25.000 --> 19:27.000
and here the data

19:27.000 --> 19:29.000
is being searched

19:29.000 --> 19:31.000
and after this

19:31.000 --> 19:33.000
we can see the style

19:33.000 --> 19:35.000
here it is taking some time to search

19:35.000 --> 19:37.000
because it takes time to call API

19:37.000 --> 19:39.000
so see this

19:39.000 --> 19:41.000
here the data

19:41.000 --> 19:43.000
which was coming from this type

19:43.000 --> 19:45.000
after styling it is of this type

19:45.000 --> 19:47.000
so here the whole info of the flight

19:47.000 --> 19:49.000
what is the name of the flight

19:49.000 --> 19:51.000
from where the flight is going

19:51.000 --> 19:53.000
how many hours it will take

19:53.000 --> 19:55.000
how many stops

19:55.000 --> 19:57.000
how much money is there for the ticket

19:57.000 --> 19:59.000
because we are talking about economy

19:59.000 --> 20:01.000
all these things are visible to you

20:01.000 --> 20:03.000
so how good is this

20:03.000 --> 20:05.000
you have taken the data of all the flights

20:05.000 --> 20:07.000
so you

20:07.000 --> 20:09.000
if you show this to anyone

20:09.000 --> 20:11.000
if you want to take any flight

20:11.000 --> 20:13.000
then you can directly search in your own site

20:13.000 --> 20:15.000
you don't have to go anywhere

20:15.000 --> 20:17.000
obviously you have to go to book

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
but you can imagine

20:19.000 --> 20:21.000
how good is the project you have made

20:21.000 --> 20:23.000
ok

20:23.000 --> 20:25.000
now we have seen all this

20:25.000 --> 20:27.000
after this we will make its header

20:27.000 --> 20:29.000
and footer
