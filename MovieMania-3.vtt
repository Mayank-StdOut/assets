WEBVTT

00:06.000 --> 00:18.000
Okay, so now we will start making our main project, where first of all I would like you to come to the same folder in which you have opened the movie mania project.

00:18.000 --> 00:22.000
So this movie mania project is made in our desktop and this is the folder.

00:22.000 --> 00:36.000
So you click here at the top where the location of the folder is and here you write cmd and after that here you write npm start.

00:36.000 --> 00:45.000
So what will happen with this is that your development server will start, the development server of react will start and your website will open on chrome.

00:45.000 --> 00:51.000
So you can do this thing on the terminal, you can also do it on the terminal of vs code, but it seems more convenient to me.

00:51.000 --> 00:52.000
So you can do this thing on the terminal, you can also do it on the terminal, but it seems more convenient to me.

00:52.000 --> 00:55.000
So you can do this thing on the terminal, you can also do it on the terminal, you can also do it on the terminal, but it seems more convenient to me.

00:55.000 --> 01:00.000
So you can do this thing on the terminal, you can also do it on the terminal, you can also do it on the terminal, you can also do it on the terminal, you can also do it on the terminal, you can also do it on the terminal,

01:00.000 --> 01:02.000
Because I have opened it on cmd.

01:02.000 --> 01:07.000
So the development server has arrived and my site is opening here, okay.

01:07.000 --> 01:13.000
So this site has opened here, this is open because after we do a work and we minimize it.

01:13.000 --> 01:21.000
So, here, the first thing is, we do not need this key, we remove it at the top.

01:21.000 --> 01:24.000
If you don't need it, then you can remove it from the page.

01:24.000 --> 01:26.000
Okay, let's save it now.

01:26.000 --> 01:35.000
Okay, so now the first thing we will need before making our website will be the API key.

01:35.000 --> 01:37.000
What is the API key?

01:37.000 --> 01:46.000
The data of the movie that we will take, the data of the movie, the photos of the movie, the year of the movie, the name of the movie.

01:46.000 --> 01:49.000
So we will fetch all this data from the API key.

01:49.000 --> 01:51.000
What is API?

01:51.000 --> 01:54.000
API is basically Application Programming Interface.

01:54.000 --> 01:57.000
You can understand it like this.

01:57.000 --> 01:59.000
It is a URL.

01:59.000 --> 02:12.000
When you call that URL, that is, when you search that URL or when you go to that URL, it gives you a particular data that can be useful to you.

02:12.000 --> 02:18.000
So here our URL will also give us a data and that data will be of the movie.

02:18.000 --> 02:19.000
Okay.

02:19.000 --> 02:21.000
So we need this right now.

02:21.000 --> 02:22.000
So let's do one thing.

02:22.000 --> 02:29.000
For that, we will go to Chrome and search OMDB API.

02:29.000 --> 02:33.000
And the top link is written as API key.

02:33.000 --> 02:35.000
You have to click here.

02:35.000 --> 02:39.000
After that, see here, the API key has come.

02:39.000 --> 02:40.000
You can also see the URL.

02:40.000 --> 02:44.000
If you come directly to this URL, then you will get this here.

02:44.000 --> 02:47.000
Now your email is asking you here.

02:47.000 --> 02:48.000
So email.

02:48.000 --> 02:53.000
I will tell you a way by which you can take a temporary email.

02:53.000 --> 02:56.000
You will go to a website by doing temp email.

02:56.000 --> 03:03.000
After that, here you will generate an email.

03:03.000 --> 03:06.000
Copy this email.

03:06.000 --> 03:09.000
And come here and paste this email.

03:09.000 --> 03:12.000
And submit it.

03:12.000 --> 03:15.000
As soon as we submit.

03:15.000 --> 03:16.000
So it is saying here.

03:16.000 --> 03:18.000
No Patreon was found.

03:18.000 --> 03:19.000
Okay.

03:19.000 --> 03:20.000
You have to select free here.

03:20.000 --> 03:21.000
Free.

03:21.000 --> 03:22.000
So what will be the free one?

03:22.000 --> 03:24.000
Actually, you will have 1000 daily limit.

03:24.000 --> 03:27.000
Means you can fetch 1000 movies data daily.

03:27.000 --> 03:28.000
So this is enough for us.

03:28.000 --> 03:30.000
After that, you can put any name here.

03:30.000 --> 03:33.000
I put anything here by doing ABCD.

03:33.000 --> 03:37.000
And after that, you put anything here by doing ABCD.

03:37.000 --> 03:38.000
It doesn't make any difference to us.

03:38.000 --> 03:40.000
You submit it.

03:40.000 --> 03:43.000
As soon as you submit.

03:43.000 --> 03:45.000
Open your email here.

03:45.000 --> 03:46.000
And see here.

03:46.000 --> 03:48.000
Email will come to you.

03:48.000 --> 03:50.000
You have to click on email.

03:50.000 --> 03:52.000
And you will get your API key here.

03:52.000 --> 03:53.000
Which is this.

03:53.000 --> 03:56.000
This is your API URL.

03:56.000 --> 03:59.000
You have to copy it as it is.

03:59.000 --> 04:03.000
And after that, you have to click on this activate link below.

04:03.000 --> 04:05.000
So that your API key gets activated.

04:05.000 --> 04:07.000
And it is done.

04:07.000 --> 04:08.000
That's it.

04:08.000 --> 04:09.000
Now you have nothing after this.

04:09.000 --> 04:10.000
You have to cut it.

04:10.000 --> 04:14.000
You have to come to your VS code after copying that link.

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
And here.

04:16.000 --> 04:20.000
Here you have to paste it at the very top.

04:20.000 --> 04:21.000
Where?

04:21.000 --> 04:22.000
Here somewhere.

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000
Do this and paste it.

04:24.000 --> 04:26.000
And put these two forward slash.

04:26.000 --> 04:27.000
What will happen with this?

04:27.000 --> 04:29.000
Your code will be commented.

04:29.000 --> 04:30.000
Ok.

04:30.000 --> 04:32.000
Now we will save it.

04:32.000 --> 04:35.000
After this, we remove it.

04:35.000 --> 04:36.000
Here we declare a variable.

04:36.000 --> 04:38.000
Which we name it.

04:38.000 --> 04:40.000
API URL.

04:40.000 --> 04:42.000
API URL.

04:42.000 --> 04:43.000
So now whatever we request.

04:43.000 --> 04:45.000
The URL on which we will send the request.

04:45.000 --> 04:48.000
It will be the API URL here.

04:48.000 --> 04:49.000
Which?

04:49.000 --> 04:50.000
The one we copied above.

04:50.000 --> 04:52.000
So we have to copy it like this.

04:52.000 --> 04:54.000
And.

04:54.000 --> 04:57.000
We paste it in this.

04:57.000 --> 04:59.000
Ok.

04:59.000 --> 05:01.000
After this.

05:01.000 --> 05:03.000
The first thing we have to do is.

05:03.000 --> 05:05.000
That we have to use this API URL.

05:05.000 --> 05:08.000
To fetch the data of any movie.

05:08.000 --> 05:10.000
So what do we have to do for this?

05:10.000 --> 05:11.000
For this.

05:11.000 --> 05:12.000
First of all.

05:12.000 --> 05:13.000
You have to remove this.

05:13.000 --> 05:14.000
From here.

05:14.000 --> 05:15.000
These parameters.

05:15.000 --> 05:18.000
From here to here.

05:18.000 --> 05:19.000
You remove it.

05:19.000 --> 05:21.000
And keep it directly like this.

05:21.000 --> 05:23.000
We only need this much URL.

05:23.000 --> 05:24.000
After this.

05:24.000 --> 05:25.000
What you have to do is.

05:25.000 --> 05:28.000
Here we will create a function.

05:28.000 --> 05:30.000
And that function.

05:30.000 --> 05:33.000
That will be basically an asynchronous function.

05:33.000 --> 05:36.000
What is asynchronous function in JavaScript?

05:36.000 --> 05:39.000
Now let's understand it with an example.

05:39.000 --> 05:40.000
For example.

05:40.000 --> 05:41.000
You went to a restaurant.

05:41.000 --> 05:45.000
And you ordered coffee from a waiter there.

05:45.000 --> 05:46.000
Then what happens?

05:46.000 --> 05:48.000
Does the waiter immediately bring coffee for you?

05:48.000 --> 05:50.000
As soon as you said I want coffee.

05:50.000 --> 05:53.000
So the waiter doesn't immediately bring coffee for you.

05:53.000 --> 05:54.000
The waiter promises you.

05:54.000 --> 05:55.000
Sir.

05:55.000 --> 05:56.000
You give me your order.

05:56.000 --> 05:59.000
And I will deliver coffee to your table.

05:59.000 --> 06:01.000
So in asynchronous JavaScript.

06:01.000 --> 06:02.000
This is the thing.

06:02.000 --> 06:04.000
That some code.

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
Can take time to run.

06:06.000 --> 06:08.000
Because here we will do the request.

06:08.000 --> 06:09.000
We will do the API key.

06:09.000 --> 06:10.000
We will do the URL.

06:10.000 --> 06:12.000
We will send the request to the URL.

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
And it can take time.

06:14.000 --> 06:15.000
That's why.

06:15.000 --> 06:18.000
Until the request is accepted.

06:18.000 --> 06:20.000
Until the request is sent.

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
Until then this asynchronous function.

06:22.000 --> 06:23.000
It runs.

06:23.000 --> 06:27.000
And it stops by bringing you data.

06:27.000 --> 06:28.000
So for now.

06:28.000 --> 06:29.000
Understand this much here.

06:29.000 --> 06:30.000
So for that we will make a function.

06:30.000 --> 06:31.000
Asynchronous function.

06:31.000 --> 06:34.000
So here you write.

06:34.000 --> 06:35.000
Const.

06:35.000 --> 06:36.000
Search movies.

06:36.000 --> 06:37.000
By doing this.

06:37.000 --> 06:38.000
We write the name of the function.

06:38.000 --> 06:39.000
And.

06:39.000 --> 06:41.000
And this is an async function.

06:41.000 --> 06:43.000
So here we will have to use an async keyword.

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
And after that.

06:45.000 --> 06:48.000
We will put our basic parameter in it.

06:48.000 --> 06:49.000
By title.

06:49.000 --> 06:51.000
So we are the title of the movie.

06:51.000 --> 06:52.000
Of the movie.

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
We will be searching for the movie details.

06:54.000 --> 06:57.000
And this is basically an arrow function.

06:57.000 --> 06:58.000
In it.

06:58.000 --> 06:59.000
Now two things will go here.

06:59.000 --> 07:01.000
The first thing will go to your response.

07:01.000 --> 07:04.000
Response variable.

07:04.000 --> 07:05.000
In which we.

07:05.000 --> 07:06.000
Whatever the data is.

07:06.000 --> 07:07.000
We will fetch there.

07:07.000 --> 07:08.000
This is the response variable.

07:08.000 --> 07:09.000
In this response variable.

07:09.000 --> 07:10.000
What does await keyword do?

07:10.000 --> 07:11.000
It waits.

07:11.000 --> 07:12.000
Until the data is fetched.

07:12.000 --> 07:13.000
And what does fetch do?

07:13.000 --> 07:14.000
Fetch.

07:14.000 --> 07:15.000
What does fetch do?

07:15.000 --> 07:16.000
Fetch.

07:16.000 --> 07:17.000
Our.

07:17.000 --> 07:18.000
API.

07:18.000 --> 07:19.000
Whatever the data is from the key.

07:19.000 --> 07:20.000
It is useful to fetch it.

07:20.000 --> 07:21.000
So here.

07:21.000 --> 07:22.000
By using back tick.

07:22.000 --> 07:23.000
In it.

07:23.000 --> 07:24.000
First of all.

07:24.000 --> 07:25.000
We will put one thing.

07:25.000 --> 07:26.000
API.

07:26.000 --> 07:27.000
URL.

07:27.000 --> 07:28.000
First parameter.

07:28.000 --> 07:29.000
API.

07:29.000 --> 07:30.000
URL.

07:30.000 --> 07:31.000
After that.

07:31.000 --> 07:32.000
By doing here.

07:32.000 --> 07:33.000
And.

07:33.000 --> 07:34.000
Here.

07:34.000 --> 07:35.000
Now.

07:35.000 --> 07:36.000
S.

07:36.000 --> 07:37.000
Is equals to.

07:37.000 --> 07:38.000
Then.

07:38.000 --> 07:39.000
Here.

07:39.000 --> 07:40.000
We.

07:40.000 --> 07:41.000
Put one.

07:41.000 --> 07:42.000
Title.

07:42.000 --> 07:43.000
That.

07:43.000 --> 07:44.000
Let's put.

07:44.000 --> 07:45.000
Title.

07:45.000 --> 07:46.000
Basically.

07:46.000 --> 07:47.000
Whatever movie we will search.

07:47.000 --> 07:48.000
Its title.

07:48.000 --> 07:49.000
After that.

07:49.000 --> 07:50.000
After this.

07:50.000 --> 07:51.000
Now.

07:51.000 --> 07:52.000
Whatever the data is.

07:52.000 --> 07:53.000
That.

07:53.000 --> 07:54.000
In the form of a json object.

07:54.000 --> 07:55.000
We have to keep.

07:55.000 --> 07:56.000
What is a json object?

07:56.000 --> 07:57.000
A.

07:57.000 --> 07:58.000
Javascript.

07:58.000 --> 07:59.000
Object.

07:59.000 --> 08:00.000
That is a.

08:00.000 --> 08:01.000
Json object.

08:01.000 --> 08:02.000
So after this.

08:02.000 --> 08:03.000
Here.

08:03.000 --> 08:04.000
Using await.

08:04.000 --> 08:05.000
Response dot.

08:05.000 --> 08:06.000
Wait.

08:06.000 --> 08:07.000
Here.

08:07.000 --> 08:08.000
Json.

08:08.000 --> 08:09.000
You.

08:09.000 --> 08:10.000
Need.

08:10.000 --> 08:11.000
So.

08:11.000 --> 08:12.000
In the form of a json.

08:12.000 --> 08:13.000
You need the data.

08:13.000 --> 08:14.000
That.

08:14.000 --> 08:15.000
You will need.

08:15.000 --> 08:16.000
Ok.

08:16.000 --> 08:17.000
After this.

08:17.000 --> 08:18.000
Now.

08:18.000 --> 08:19.000
What do we do?

08:19.000 --> 08:20.000
This.

08:20.000 --> 08:21.000
We.

08:21.000 --> 08:22.000
Once in the console.

08:22.000 --> 08:23.000
Let's print it.

08:23.000 --> 08:24.000
Let's see.

08:24.000 --> 08:25.000
Whether we have the data of the movie.

08:25.000 --> 08:26.000
Which we want.

08:26.000 --> 08:27.000
Is it coming or not?

08:27.000 --> 08:28.000
Data dot.

08:28.000 --> 08:29.000
Search.

08:29.000 --> 08:30.000
Or we just.

08:30.000 --> 08:31.000
Console dot.

08:31.000 --> 08:32.000
Log data.

08:32.000 --> 08:33.000
Let's do it.

08:33.000 --> 08:34.000
Now.
