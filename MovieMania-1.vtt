00:06.000 --> 00:11.500
So, before we make a React project, we have to install two important things.

00:11.500 --> 00:13.500
The first thing is Node.js.

00:13.500 --> 00:14.500
So, what is Node.js?

00:14.500 --> 00:17.500
Node.js is basically a JavaScript runtime.

00:17.500 --> 00:23.500
That is, the JavaScript language was first made to be used in browsers.

00:23.500 --> 00:29.000
But as developers started liking this language more and it became more convenient to use,

00:29.000 --> 00:33.000
a runtime of JavaScript was created, which we call Node.js.

00:33.000 --> 00:41.000
What it does is, by using its functionality, you can use JavaScript like other programming languages in your computer.

00:41.000 --> 00:44.000
Just like you use Python and C++.

00:44.000 --> 00:48.000
And you can also use it on the server side.

00:48.000 --> 00:56.000
So, first we install Node.js and when we will be doing our project further, you will understand it better.

00:56.000 --> 00:59.000
So, to install Node.js, you have to search for Node.js.

00:59.000 --> 01:00.000
You have to enter it.

01:00.000 --> 01:01.000
It is the first website.

01:01.000 --> 01:03.000
You have to click on it.

01:03.000 --> 01:06.000
And you have to click on the recommended for most users.

01:06.000 --> 01:09.000
As you will click here, you will save it here.

01:09.000 --> 01:11.000
Here you can see the downloaded file.

01:11.000 --> 01:12.000
You will save it.

01:12.000 --> 01:15.000
So, here you can see that our download has started.

01:15.000 --> 01:16.000
Okay.

01:16.000 --> 01:19.000
So, after downloading, you just have to click on the basic setup.

01:19.000 --> 01:23.000
Just like you install the rest of the apps, you have to click on next, next and click on install.

01:23.000 --> 01:25.000
So, your app will be installed.

01:25.000 --> 01:27.000
Now, I will not show you the whole setup after installing it.

01:27.000 --> 01:29.000
Because I have already installed it.

01:29.000 --> 01:31.000
And it is very easy.

01:31.000 --> 01:35.000
You can also just click on next, next and click on install and install it.

01:35.000 --> 01:37.000
As you will click here on the setup.

01:37.000 --> 01:39.000
And you have clicked on it.

01:39.000 --> 01:40.000
Okay.

01:40.000 --> 01:42.000
After that, you will see the next, next button below.

01:42.000 --> 01:44.000
Here you have to click on the next, next button.

01:44.000 --> 01:46.000
Then you have to accept the agreement here.

01:46.000 --> 01:48.000
And you have to install it by doing next, next.

01:48.000 --> 01:49.000
Okay.

01:49.000 --> 01:51.000
Your install will be completed.

01:51.000 --> 01:53.000
Now, after that, you have to check one more thing.

01:53.000 --> 01:57.000
When it is installed, you have to open your command prompt.

01:57.000 --> 01:58.000
And after opening it.

01:58.000 --> 01:59.000
You have to type something here.

01:59.000 --> 02:03.000
Note space minus V.

02:03.000 --> 02:04.000
As soon as you type it.

02:04.000 --> 02:07.000
Then you will get the version of your note space.

02:07.000 --> 02:09.000
That which version you have installed.

02:09.000 --> 02:11.000
So, here I have done 16th.

02:11.000 --> 02:13.000
If your version is more or less than this.

02:13.000 --> 02:14.000
If the version is more.

02:14.000 --> 02:15.000
Then it should not be less.

02:15.000 --> 02:17.000
Because you have just installed it.

02:17.000 --> 02:21.000
So, your version after this or after this.

02:21.000 --> 02:24.000
So, your version will be showing there.

02:24.000 --> 02:25.000
Okay.

02:25.000 --> 02:26.000
This work will be done on everyone.

02:26.000 --> 02:27.000
There is no need to worry.

02:27.000 --> 02:28.000
So, when you install it.

02:28.000 --> 02:30.000
Your first work is done.

02:30.000 --> 02:32.000
The second thing you have to install is VSCode.

02:32.000 --> 02:35.000
Then you have to search for VSCode.

02:35.000 --> 02:38.000
And VSCode is basically a code editor.

02:38.000 --> 02:40.000
Which is developed by Windows.

02:40.000 --> 02:41.000
To do coding.

02:41.000 --> 02:43.000
That means you can write your codes in it.

02:43.000 --> 02:44.000
You can do file management.

02:44.000 --> 02:46.000
You can do a lot of things in it.

02:46.000 --> 02:47.000
It is very convenient.

02:47.000 --> 02:49.000
Why are we using only this?

02:49.000 --> 02:51.000
In other things like notepad.

02:51.000 --> 02:53.000
We used to make websites in childhood.

02:53.000 --> 02:55.000
Why are we not using it?

02:55.000 --> 02:56.000
We are using it because.

02:56.000 --> 02:59.000
Because it is very convenient to write your code in it.

02:59.000 --> 03:01.000
Here you get code suggestions.

03:01.000 --> 03:04.000
After that here you get syntax highlighting.

03:04.000 --> 03:06.000
Sometimes you get an error.

03:06.000 --> 03:07.000
It is coming.

03:07.000 --> 03:08.000
So, this is also informed to you.

03:08.000 --> 03:12.000
So, you can do all things conveniently in it.

03:12.000 --> 03:15.000
And you will understand these things well in the future.

03:15.000 --> 03:17.000
So, here you will just click on download for Windows.

03:17.000 --> 03:19.000
And here your download will start.

03:19.000 --> 03:20.000
You will save it.

03:20.000 --> 03:21.000
And it will download.

03:21.000 --> 03:24.000
And the same process you have to install by clicking next next.

03:24.000 --> 03:25.000
This install will be completed.

03:25.000 --> 03:27.000
After that.

03:27.000 --> 03:29.000
As soon as your VSCode is installed.

03:29.000 --> 03:32.000
So, something like this will open for you.

03:32.000 --> 03:34.000
See, mine is installed.

03:34.000 --> 03:36.000
So, it is also opening something like this.

03:36.000 --> 03:37.000
And when it will be installed.

03:37.000 --> 03:38.000
When you click on finish.

03:38.000 --> 03:40.000
So, something like this is going to open for you.

03:40.000 --> 03:41.000
VSCode.

03:41.000 --> 03:42.000
Okay.

03:42.000 --> 03:43.000
So, you will get a welcome page.

03:43.000 --> 03:45.000
So, you cut it.

03:45.000 --> 03:46.000
Now here you see.

03:46.000 --> 03:48.000
It is asking to create a new folder.

03:48.000 --> 03:49.000
To create a new file.

03:49.000 --> 03:51.000
So, you can create a new file by clicking here.

03:51.000 --> 03:53.000
You can create a new folder by clicking on it.

03:53.000 --> 03:54.000
And by doing this.

03:54.000 --> 03:58.000
You can refresh the files.

03:58.000 --> 03:59.000
Lastly.

03:59.000 --> 04:00.000
When you have installed this much.

04:00.000 --> 04:01.000
Then after that.

04:01.000 --> 04:02.000
What you have to do is.

04:02.000 --> 04:03.000
Click on view.

04:03.000 --> 04:05.000
So, you have to click on view.

04:05.000 --> 04:06.000
And by clicking on view.

04:06.000 --> 04:08.000
You have to click on extensions here.

04:08.000 --> 04:10.000
You will click on extensions.

04:10.000 --> 04:12.000
And you have to search here ES7.

04:12.000 --> 04:14.000
What are these extensions?

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
They make it more convenient to write your code.

04:16.000 --> 04:17.000
And.

04:17.000 --> 04:19.000
Add some utilities.

04:19.000 --> 04:20.000
Okay.

04:20.000 --> 04:21.000
So, you just install it.

04:21.000 --> 04:23.000
Now you don't have to understand much here.

04:23.000 --> 04:26.000
So, you will search in ES7.

04:26.000 --> 04:28.000
You will click here first.

04:28.000 --> 04:29.000
And.

04:29.000 --> 04:30.000
I have installed it just now.

04:30.000 --> 04:32.000
So, I am getting this option here.

04:32.000 --> 04:33.000
You will get the install option here.

04:33.000 --> 04:35.000
You have to click on install.

04:35.000 --> 04:36.000
After that.

04:36.000 --> 04:38.000
You have to install this one below it.

04:38.000 --> 04:41.000
So, here our first thing is completed.

04:41.000 --> 04:44.000
You have to come back to the floor by clicking on view.

04:44.000 --> 04:47.000
So, our first setup is completed.

04:47.000 --> 04:48.000
VS Code.

04:48.000 --> 04:49.000
Installation.

04:49.000 --> 04:50.000
And NodeJS installation.
