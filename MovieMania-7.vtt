WEBVTT

00:06.000 --> 00:27.060
So now we are making a header, header means the navigation bar of the top, now we will make that and it will be a very simple navigation bar so that our site looks better, so what we will do for that, we will go back to the source folder and make a new component whose name we will name header.jsx, so we will name it header.jsx.

00:27.060 --> 00:46.060
First of all, we will do our things there by doing rfc, after that we will set the language to jsx again, you will remember how to set the language, it will be written by doing javascript in the bottom right corner, you have to type jsx by clicking there and your jsx will be set.

00:46.060 --> 00:57.060
After that what you have to do, now you have to do the first thing here that you have to go to a div and a nav,

00:57.060 --> 01:16.060
after that you have to use your tag and you have to give the class name of it, you have to give the class name of it, translucent navbar, translucent navbar is the class that we have given, we have defined it in our style sheet,

01:16.060 --> 01:25.060
in this we have named it according to the properties of the navbar, now what you have to do here, you have to make another div in it,

01:25.060 --> 01:27.060
which you have to name navcontainer.

01:27.060 --> 01:39.060
After naming navcontainer, you have to make a div, so if you write .navcontainer here, then that div will automatically be made, .navcontainer, so your div will be made.

01:39.060 --> 01:54.060
In this div, the first thing you need is that there should be our logo in our navigation bar, the second thing should be that there should be a search button in which if we click on search, then we go directly to the search bar.

01:54.060 --> 01:55.060
So what we will do for that?

01:55.060 --> 02:09.060
We will go here and here we will first do the image and we will leave the source as it is, and after that the first thing we need is the image, the second thing we need is a link in an unordered list,

02:09.060 --> 02:22.060
so there should be an unordered list and the unordered list should have its class name, we will keep its class name navlinks, so we will keep its class name navlinks.

02:22.060 --> 02:23.060
Now what will we do after this?

02:23.060 --> 02:24.060
Now what will we do?

02:24.060 --> 02:46.060
We will add a list content in it, the first list content will be our button, so there will be an anchor tag in it, there will be an anchor tag in it, and we will keep its href, we will define its href later, first we put the name of the button here, we put the name of movies.

02:47.060 --> 02:50.060
So this our basic header app is ready.

02:50.060 --> 02:51.060
But this will not look special now.

02:51.060 --> 02:52.060
Because we have written code in it.

02:52.060 --> 02:53.060
So we have written code in it.

02:53.060 --> 02:57.060
no CSS has been added to the header.

02:57.060 --> 03:01.060
So, we will define a CSS for the header.

03:01.060 --> 03:05.060
For that, we will go back to the source and create a file

03:05.060 --> 03:09.060
called header.css.

03:09.060 --> 03:13.060
And what we will do is, in header.css,

03:13.060 --> 03:17.060
CSS has been given in the code section again. So, you have to use

03:17.060 --> 03:21.060
that CSS. So, we copied the CSS from there and pasted it here.

03:21.060 --> 03:25.060
In header.css. So, now let me explain

03:25.060 --> 03:29.060
what is in it. So, the glass called TranslucentNavBar

03:29.060 --> 03:33.060
in header.jsx. So, the style

03:33.060 --> 03:37.060
of this will be something like this. Its background color will be something like this.

03:37.060 --> 03:41.060
The height will be this much. The width will be this much. And the z-index tells us

03:41.060 --> 03:45.060
how much it should look up. In z-axis, how much it should look up.

03:45.060 --> 03:49.060
So, this is what the z-index tells us.

03:49.060 --> 03:53.060
So, we have given these properties to the nav-content

03:53.060 --> 03:57.060
which also includes nav-links. And justify-content-space-between.

03:57.060 --> 04:01.060
And the logo that we will use, we have given its color white. So, we have added these properties here.

04:01.060 --> 04:05.060
Again, we go to our header.js.

04:05.060 --> 04:09.060
And the first thing that we will be setting here is our logo.

04:09.060 --> 04:13.060
So, to set the logo, we also need a logo here.

04:13.060 --> 04:17.060
So, what we do is, you will get a link in the link section.

04:17.060 --> 04:21.060
So, you can pick up the logo from there. You can download it from there.

04:21.060 --> 04:25.060
Or you can directly use the link. And the logo is

04:25.060 --> 04:29.060
something like this. I will show you.

04:29.060 --> 04:33.060
You will get the logo by typing y2.png

04:33.060 --> 04:37.060
So, I will put this logo in the source folder.

04:37.060 --> 04:41.060
These are some logos. Now, what we have to do is go to header.js

04:41.060 --> 04:45.060
You have to import this logo. So, you will import it.

04:45.060 --> 04:49.060
And we will put its path.

04:49.060 --> 04:53.060
LogoMoviewhite.png

04:53.060 --> 04:57.060
What is its name? LogoMoviewhite.png

04:57.060 --> 05:01.060
So, you can import the logo with this name.

05:01.060 --> 05:05.060
So, one minute. After that,

05:05.060 --> 05:09.060
we have to do something like this.

05:09.060 --> 05:13.060
And here we have to use from. And our logo has been imported.

05:13.060 --> 05:17.060
Now, you have to directly use that logo instead of image source.

05:17.060 --> 05:21.060
So, you will write logo here. So, you will be able to use that logo here.

05:21.060 --> 05:25.060
And here you can write movie mania.

05:25.060 --> 05:29.060
Okay. This thing which is our header is almost ready.

05:29.060 --> 05:33.060
Now, after this, what we have to do here is that

05:33.060 --> 05:37.060
we have to give some style to the image. So, the width of the image

05:37.060 --> 05:41.060
What do we keep? We keep the width of the image around 10%.

05:41.060 --> 05:45.060
So, in style, we give the width to the image.

05:45.060 --> 05:49.060
And the width will be something like

05:49.060 --> 05:53.060
around 10%. So, we have given some width to the image.

05:53.060 --> 05:57.060
Now, here we have to save it.

05:57.060 --> 06:01.060
And this header, we have to import this header

06:01.060 --> 06:05.060
in our app.js.

06:05.060 --> 06:09.060
Import header.

06:09.060 --> 06:13.060
And to use this header, you have to keep it above the movie carousel.

06:13.060 --> 06:17.060
Because this is a header. So, it should be above the movie carousel.

06:17.060 --> 06:21.060
Now, we will go to our chrome and check it once.

06:21.060 --> 06:25.060
So, now there is some error here. Okay. So, here it says

06:25.060 --> 06:29.060
can't import the logo. So, okay.

06:29.060 --> 06:33.060
We will go to our header once. And the brackets

06:33.060 --> 06:37.060
which we have put here, we will remove them. Okay. Now,

06:37.060 --> 06:41.060
let's check it. So, now see, here you have

06:41.060 --> 06:45.060
some movie mania navbar. But it looks

06:45.060 --> 06:49.060
so dirty. You can see that it is not looking good at all.

06:49.060 --> 06:53.060
Here, only movie mania and movies are showing. Because we have not

06:53.060 --> 06:57.060
imported css here. We have to import css too. So, what will we do?

06:57.060 --> 07:01.060
First of all, we will go and import css here.

07:01.060 --> 07:05.060
In header. Import header.css.

07:07.060 --> 07:11.060
Header.css.

07:11.060 --> 07:15.060
Now, as soon as you import header.css, and once you go and check it.

07:15.060 --> 07:19.060
So, here, now there is also

07:19.060 --> 07:23.060
some problem. Let's check it once. Is there any problem?

07:23.060 --> 07:27.060
This is header.css. Okay. We haven't saved this. We have to save this too.

07:27.060 --> 07:31.060
Okay. So, now we have saved it too. Now, we will go to chrome once and see.

07:31.060 --> 07:35.060
Our header looks good now. Our header

07:35.060 --> 07:39.060
is here in which we are writing movie mania and

07:39.060 --> 07:43.060
the movie button is also here. But when we click on the movie button

07:43.060 --> 07:47.060
then nothing will happen. So, what we want is that when we click on the movie button

07:47.060 --> 07:51.060
then after this, we come here.

07:51.060 --> 07:55.060
We come inside this search movies. So, what will we do?

07:55.060 --> 07:59.060
We will directly minimize it. And after this, we will go

07:59.060 --> 08:03.060
to our header.css. And in href, we will put the hashtag search.

08:05.060 --> 08:09.060
Now, what will we do? We have put the hashtag search. We will go to our app.js.

08:09.060 --> 08:13.060
Now, what will happen is that whenever someone will click on the movie button in the header.

08:13.060 --> 08:17.060
So, the hashtag search will come directly in the search div

08:17.060 --> 08:21.060
in this page. So, let's go to chrome once.

08:21.060 --> 08:25.060
And now, let's see. So, we come here in chrome. And as soon as we

08:25.060 --> 08:29.060
clicked on movies, we came to search. Directly below.

08:29.060 --> 08:33.060
Now, we can search anything here. So, our header is also

08:35.060 --> 08:39.060
here. So, finally, after the header is completed, we should also

08:39.060 --> 08:43.060
put a footer. So that our web page looks good.

08:43.060 --> 08:47.060
So, to put a footer, there is a very simple code.

08:47.060 --> 08:51.060
This is optional. If you want to put it, then you can put it.

08:51.060 --> 08:55.060
Otherwise, you can leave it as it is. There is also a

08:55.060 --> 08:59.060
code for the footer. It is a very small code. So, the code for the footer

08:59.060 --> 09:03.060
you can directly copy it and go to app.js. And there

09:03.060 --> 09:07.060
is a code for the footer. Just here at the end.

09:07.060 --> 09:11.060
Now, paste it. So, the code given at the end is

09:11.060 --> 09:15.060
the footer code. Now, in this, you have given logo w

09:15.060 --> 09:19.060
in the source. So, you will also need this logo w

09:19.060 --> 09:23.060
in your source folder. So, what will you do for this?

09:23.060 --> 09:27.060
This logo w, first of all,

09:27.060 --> 09:31.060
you will search in the links section. And that logo w

09:31.060 --> 09:35.060
is your logo-white.png. So, the logo-white

09:35.060 --> 09:39.060
we will source it. We already have it. So, we will not

09:39.060 --> 09:43.060
put it back. So, we will leave it as it is. So, we will cancel it.

09:43.060 --> 09:47.060
And directly we will import this logo. So, to import it,

09:47.060 --> 09:51.060
we have already imported it in the header. So, we will pick it up from here.

09:51.060 --> 09:55.060
And here we will go back to app.js.

09:55.060 --> 09:59.060
And here we will import it.

09:59.060 --> 10:03.060
And we will name it logo-w.

10:03.060 --> 10:07.060
Okay. As soon as you do this, after this

10:07.060 --> 10:11.060
you go back to chrome. After going to chrome,

10:11.060 --> 10:15.060
something has come here. Year is not defined. Okay.

10:15.060 --> 10:19.060
So, there is one more thing. What we will show in our footer is

10:19.060 --> 10:23.060
we will have to show the year too. Here we have written copyright at the rate

10:23.060 --> 10:27.060
this this. So, what is copyright current year? So, for current year, we will do one thing.

10:27.060 --> 10:29.060
For current year, we will show here

10:29.060 --> 10:33.060
a function in java script

10:33.060 --> 10:37.060
to define year. First, we will fetch current year. For that, we will go

10:37.060 --> 10:41.060
down from here. Here we will make a variable by

10:41.060 --> 10:45.060
const date. After that, we will use

10:45.060 --> 10:49.060
date function. We will use date function. And after that,

10:49.060 --> 10:53.060
we will use const year. Here

10:53.060 --> 10:57.060
we will use date.getFullYear.

10:57.060 --> 11:01.060
Here we will fetch year. So, here you will notice

11:01.060 --> 11:05.060
one thing that I have put semicolon somewhere or not.

11:05.060 --> 11:09.060
So, semicolon is optional in java script. If you want to put, then do it.

11:09.060 --> 11:13.060
If you don't want to put, then don't. There will be no error. So, here we have

11:13.060 --> 11:17.060
stored year in year variable. Now, this thing has come directly here.

11:17.060 --> 11:21.060
Now, let's go to chrome and run it.

11:21.060 --> 11:25.060
So, there is no error now. And now I will take you to the website.

11:25.060 --> 11:29.060
See, at the bottom, our beautiful footer is

11:29.060 --> 11:33.220
ready.
