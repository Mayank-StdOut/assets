WEBVTT

00:06.000 --> 00:29.980
So now let's start making our about and contact page, okay, so now the logic that we put in the home page is exactly the same logic in the about page and the same logic is in the contact page, we will use the use effect and compare the id with our gmail which exists in the profile and if it happens then only we will show the data, okay, so it is the same thing,

00:30.000 --> 00:55.680
and the designs are also basically simple designs, so all these things are provided to you, right, so you understood the main logic by implementing it in the home page, now you have to replicate the same logic, just the same logic in the about and contact page, okay, so we have given you the code, just you have to bring it here and here you have to understand it right now, that what we have done basically, so see what we have done here,

00:56.080 --> 00:58.980
we have done here, first of all, our,

00:59.320 --> 00:59.820
whatever,

01:00.000 --> 01:28.900
important things have been imported, header, footer, etc., everything, we have taken the id, we have taken the user data, which we were taking earlier in the home page and the same is exactly the same logic, which we had put in the home page, we have fetched here, all the data of the user email, which is the id at the rate gmail dot com, and we have set it in the user data, if the user gets it, then it is good, we set it in the user data, otherwise we redirect it to such a place where it will be 404 page,

01:28.900 --> 01:31.080
if everything will show got it after

01:31.360 --> 01:32.160
this,

01:32.160 --> 01:33.960
after this we have put a

01:34.900 --> 01:36.500
simple, our basically, our

01:36.600 --> 01:42.840
design, what is

01:42.840 --> 01:45.600
the first thingpack as we have had the user data here,

01:45.600 --> 01:53.100
if it exists, then we will render our div with the help of this Tigers 것을

01:53.440 --> 01:56.200
, this element or this element, which we will enter for

01:56.200 --> 01:56.820
a minute,

01:57.300 --> 01:58.200
this is rendering,

01:58.900 --> 02:01.900
Where is it? I think, I think.

02:01.900 --> 02:02.900
It is here.

02:02.900 --> 02:04.900
Okay, we will render this div.

02:04.900 --> 02:07.900
Else, we will be showing loading there.

02:07.900 --> 02:10.900
So, I will have to check for a minute where it is.

02:10.900 --> 02:12.900
Okay, it is here.

02:12.900 --> 02:13.900
See this.

02:13.900 --> 02:15.900
User data.length 0.

02:15.900 --> 02:17.900
User data.length 0.

02:17.900 --> 02:19.900
So, we will show this div to it.

02:19.900 --> 02:21.900
Which div? This div.

02:21.900 --> 02:26.900
We will show this div in which the user will see the image, first name and last name.

02:26.900 --> 02:27.900
Otherwise, he will see loading.

02:27.900 --> 02:32.900
So, if the user does not exist, then he will write loading.

02:32.900 --> 02:36.900
And if it exists, then the image will be shown as we did in the home page.

02:36.900 --> 02:38.900
Using user data 0.profilePicture.

02:38.900 --> 02:40.900
Otherwise, what will happen to the user here?

02:40.900 --> 02:43.900
First name, which exists only in the user data.

02:43.900 --> 02:46.900
Plus, space, last name.

02:46.900 --> 02:48.900
This thing will show to the user.

02:48.900 --> 02:51.900
And this thing will come by saying hello, I am.

02:51.900 --> 02:52.900
After this, the same thing is here.

02:52.900 --> 02:54.900
The user will see about here.

02:54.900 --> 02:57.900
And if about does not exist, then noBioAvailability.

02:57.900 --> 03:00.900
Now, the last thing to understand is this.

03:00.900 --> 03:01.900
What have we done here?

03:01.900 --> 03:03.900
Here we will see the user's skills.

03:03.900 --> 03:05.900
And we will see using this thing.

03:05.900 --> 03:06.900
What have we done here?

03:06.900 --> 03:09.900
Here we have used the map.

03:09.900 --> 03:11.900
And whatever our object is.

03:11.900 --> 03:12.900
Let me show you this once.

03:12.900 --> 03:14.900
We go to the web page.

03:14.900 --> 03:19.900
And basically, we print our object array in the home page first.

03:19.900 --> 03:21.900
Either we go directly to about.

03:21.900 --> 03:22.900
We went to about.

03:22.900 --> 03:26.900
And you will see here that something like this is running on our about page.

03:26.900 --> 03:27.900
What happened?

03:27.900 --> 03:30.900
Until the data was not there, it came by loading there.

03:30.900 --> 03:33.900
And as soon as the data came, it showed the whole data here.

03:33.900 --> 03:35.900
Here the skills are shown.

03:35.900 --> 03:38.900
After the skills, your work experience is being shown here.

03:38.900 --> 03:39.900
Right?

03:39.900 --> 03:40.900
You have not done anything.

03:40.900 --> 03:45.900
You have just designed and just displayed the thing that we have extracted from the sanity.

03:45.900 --> 03:46.900
It is very simple.

03:46.900 --> 03:48.900
And here your name is Tecidicon.

03:48.900 --> 03:49.900
This is coming.

03:49.900 --> 03:53.900
And here you are getting whatever is about.

03:53.900 --> 03:54.900
Okay.

03:54.900 --> 03:55.900
Now, let me show you the object once.

03:55.900 --> 03:57.900
So, let's print the object here.

03:57.900 --> 03:58.900
Quickly.

03:58.900 --> 04:00.900
You must be seeing this web page.

04:00.900 --> 04:03.900
Now, let's print the object here.

04:03.900 --> 04:05.900
So, let's go here.

04:05.900 --> 04:08.900
And let's do console.log here.

04:08.900 --> 04:10.900
Dot log.

04:10.900 --> 04:12.900
User data.

04:12.900 --> 04:16.900
Let's do console.log here for user data.

04:16.900 --> 04:18.900
After that, let's come here again.

04:18.900 --> 04:22.900
And here we have once.

04:22.900 --> 04:24.900
User data has come to us.

04:24.900 --> 04:26.900
Now, as soon as you go to user data, you will see here.

04:26.900 --> 04:30.900
Skill 1, Skill 2, Skill 3, Skill 4.

04:30.900 --> 04:31.900
So, you must be seeing these skills here.

04:31.900 --> 04:32.900
These are the skills.

04:32.900 --> 04:34.900
You must be seeing these skills.

04:34.900 --> 04:36.900
So, what have we done there?

04:36.900 --> 04:41.900
That basically, we have rendered the skills at this place.

04:41.900 --> 04:42.900
At the bottom.

04:42.900 --> 04:43.900
We have not done anything.

04:43.900 --> 04:44.900
We have used the map function.

04:44.900 --> 04:46.900
And we have filtered it out.

04:46.900 --> 04:49.900
First, we have extracted all the keys of that object.

04:49.900 --> 04:51.900
We have extracted all the keys of the object of user data.

04:51.900 --> 04:53.900
That is, user profile picture, user email, user name.

04:53.900 --> 04:55.900
First name, last name, skill 1, skill 2.

04:55.900 --> 04:57.900
All the keys have come from this.

04:57.900 --> 05:00.900
Now, among them, we have filtered out those keys.

05:00.900 --> 05:02.900
Which start by doing skills.

05:02.900 --> 05:05.900
So, we saw skill 1, skill 2, skill 3, skill 4.

05:05.900 --> 05:07.900
So, we have filtered this out.

05:07.900 --> 05:10.900
And we have run the map function on them.

05:10.900 --> 05:12.900
We have run the map function on them.

05:12.900 --> 05:15.900
And we have rendered them one by one.

05:15.900 --> 05:16.900
Something like this.

05:16.900 --> 05:19.900
We have rendered those keys from the user data.

05:19.900 --> 05:21.900
Which we have mapped.

05:21.900 --> 05:22.900
So, it is showing here.

05:22.900 --> 05:24.900
Basically, it was simple.

05:24.900 --> 05:26.900
Now, the same thing is here.

05:26.900 --> 05:29.900
We will do the same thing on the about contact page too.

05:29.900 --> 05:31.900
We will go to contact.

05:31.900 --> 05:32.900
It also has a code.

05:32.900 --> 05:33.900
We will paste it too.

05:33.900 --> 05:36.900
And here, the same thing is happening on the contact page too.

05:36.900 --> 05:38.900
That the user will be checked first.

05:38.900 --> 05:41.900
After checking, the user's info will be shown.

05:41.900 --> 05:43.900
And here, I will show you the contact page.

05:43.900 --> 05:44.900
How is it looking?

05:44.900 --> 05:46.900
Now, we will remove it.

05:46.900 --> 05:48.900
And here, as soon as we.

05:48.900 --> 05:49.900
Now, notice one more thing.

05:49.900 --> 05:51.900
As soon as we click on navbar in home.

05:51.900 --> 05:53.900
In home, the page has not been reloaded.

05:53.900 --> 05:55.900
You can see that the page is not being reloaded.

05:55.900 --> 05:58.900
In contact, the page is not being reloaded.

05:58.900 --> 06:01.900
In about, the page is not being reloaded.

06:01.900 --> 06:02.900
Okay.

06:02.900 --> 06:04.900
So, in contact, we will see something like this.

06:04.900 --> 06:05.900
This is nothing.

06:05.900 --> 06:08.900
Basically, we have put a value in the input box.

06:08.900 --> 06:10.900
So, we cannot change this.

06:10.900 --> 06:12.900
We cannot change this.

06:12.900 --> 06:14.900
And on top of that, the send message button.

06:14.900 --> 06:16.900
As soon as we click on it.

06:16.900 --> 06:18.900
There is a mail to method in the HTML.

06:18.900 --> 06:19.900
We have used that.

06:19.900 --> 06:20.900
So, we will go back.

06:20.900 --> 06:21.900
So, we will go back.

06:21.900 --> 06:24.900
And this is basically a mail to method in JSX.

06:24.900 --> 06:27.900
So, here we have used this.

06:27.900 --> 06:31.900
So, as soon as the person clicks on the submit message button.

06:31.900 --> 06:35.900
As soon as the user clicks on the send message button.

06:35.900 --> 06:38.900
As soon as he clicks, this function runs.

06:38.900 --> 06:40.900
The page is saved from being reloaded.

06:40.900 --> 06:41.900
And where does the user come here?

06:41.900 --> 06:43.900
In the mail to method.

06:43.900 --> 06:44.900
There is a mail to method.

06:44.900 --> 06:46.900
In front of this, whatever email you will put.

06:46.900 --> 06:48.900
So, it will open your email by default.

06:48.900 --> 06:49.900
Okay.

06:49.900 --> 06:51.900
So, if the email of the user exists.

06:51.900 --> 06:53.900
So, it will run on the email of the user.

06:53.900 --> 06:55.900
So, we will go back to the web page.

06:55.900 --> 06:58.900
And as soon as we click on the send message.

06:58.900 --> 07:01.900
So, our mail will open by default by itself.

07:01.900 --> 07:02.900
You will see.

07:02.900 --> 07:04.900
So, our mail has opened here.

07:04.900 --> 07:06.900
If you go to about.

07:06.900 --> 07:09.900
So, you will see the about of the user here.

07:09.900 --> 07:12.900
If you go to home, you will see all these things.

07:12.900 --> 07:14.900
So, now we have to see one more thing here.

07:14.900 --> 07:17.900
For example, this ID user is existing.

07:17.900 --> 07:18.900
Okay.

07:18.900 --> 07:20.900
So, here this page is showing us.

07:20.900 --> 07:22.900
If there is any such ID whose user does not exist.

07:22.900 --> 07:24.900
For example, by doing something like this.

07:24.900 --> 07:25.900
We hit enter.

07:25.900 --> 07:26.900
So, see.

07:26.900 --> 07:28.900
Here it is redirecting us to page 404.

07:28.900 --> 07:29.900
Okay.

07:29.900 --> 07:31.900
And before this, it was showing by loading.

07:31.900 --> 07:33.900
Because at that time it did not get any data.

07:33.900 --> 07:35.900
After that, it redirected to 404.

07:35.900 --> 07:37.900
Now, the page 404.

07:37.900 --> 07:39.900
We will have to show something good here.

07:39.900 --> 07:41.900
This 404 is not looking good directly.

07:41.900 --> 07:42.900
So, what do we do?

07:42.900 --> 07:43.900
Let's go.

07:43.900 --> 07:46.900
And we also give it a small style.

07:46.900 --> 07:47.900
So, we will go.

07:47.900 --> 07:49.900
We have made it in not found.jsx.

07:49.900 --> 07:52.900
And in that, we have given you this style.

07:52.900 --> 07:54.900
You can directly paste it.

07:54.900 --> 07:56.900
It is a very small and beautiful style.

07:56.900 --> 07:58.900
We will go back to the web page.

07:58.900 --> 07:59.900
So, something like this will be seen.

07:59.900 --> 08:01.900
So, page 404 looks very beautiful.

08:01.900 --> 08:03.900
As soon as we go to go back to home.

08:03.900 --> 08:05.900
So, you will come here.

08:05.900 --> 08:06.900
So, now as soon as you go.

08:06.900 --> 08:08.900
In this, you will get it here.

08:08.900 --> 08:10.900
If someone does not exist.

08:10.900 --> 08:13.900
So, then here you will get page 404.

08:13.900 --> 08:16.900
For example, you want to go to taggy recon.

08:16.900 --> 08:18.900
But you are accessing a page which is not there.

08:18.900 --> 08:19.900
Like by helping.

08:19.900 --> 08:20.900
This is not there.

08:20.900 --> 08:22.900
So, then you will come to 404.

08:22.900 --> 08:23.900
Isn't it?

08:23.900 --> 08:25.900
And you will enter in taggy recon.

08:25.900 --> 08:27.900
So, you will come to taggy recon page.
