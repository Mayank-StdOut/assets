00:06.000 --> 00:15.000
So now we know that the header part of our extension has a welcome message written on it.

00:15.000 --> 00:17.000
Let me show you once.

00:17.000 --> 00:20.000
So our extension is this.

00:20.000 --> 00:22.000
And here it is written welcome.

00:22.000 --> 00:25.000
As soon as I click, it remains welcome.

00:25.000 --> 00:29.000
We do one thing to make it better.

00:29.000 --> 00:33.000
When it is analyzed, we write analyzing here.

00:33.000 --> 00:37.000
When the summary comes here, the summary will be written there.

00:37.000 --> 00:40.000
So the above content will be dynamically changed.

00:40.000 --> 00:44.000
So you must be understanding how this can happen.

00:44.000 --> 00:48.000
We will take the states here and change the states.

00:48.000 --> 00:50.000
You must be understanding this thing a little.

00:50.000 --> 00:52.000
So we will do something like this.

00:52.000 --> 00:55.000
But here you will get to learn a new concept.

00:55.000 --> 00:58.000
So now we go to our VSCode.

00:58.000 --> 01:06.000
And here we see that our header component is in this component.

01:06.000 --> 01:11.000
And we can set this thing with our popup.tsx.

01:11.000 --> 01:13.000
Because what do we do here first?

01:13.000 --> 01:15.000
I will tell you this.

01:15.000 --> 01:19.000
What will happen in popup.tsx?

01:19.000 --> 01:23.000
What do we have in popup.tsx?

01:23.000 --> 01:25.000
We know when what is being summarized.

01:25.000 --> 01:26.000
When it is being analyzed.

01:26.000 --> 01:28.000
And when the result will be shown.

01:28.000 --> 01:30.000
We know this thing.

01:30.000 --> 01:34.000
And we will have to send this thing in the header from the popup.

01:34.000 --> 01:36.000
Because our header component.

01:36.000 --> 01:38.000
We will show that thing here.

01:38.000 --> 01:40.000
What is the current status going on?

01:40.000 --> 01:42.000
Here we will show the status here.

01:42.000 --> 01:43.000
Status.

01:43.000 --> 01:49.000
Here it is said that we will show our current status here.

01:49.000 --> 01:52.000
So to bring current status here, we will bring it through props.

01:52.000 --> 01:54.000
But one thing is that we will not use header in popup.tsx.

01:55.000 --> 01:58.000
We are using header in our app.tsx.

01:58.000 --> 02:02.000
So we will have to do something like this.

02:02.000 --> 02:08.000
That we will have to put current status in header from popup.

02:08.000 --> 02:10.000
Now how will we put that?

02:10.000 --> 02:16.000
This is a question that how will we put header from popup when we are not using header here.

02:16.000 --> 02:19.000
So now we will use functions for this.

02:19.000 --> 02:23.000
And by using function we will set a state through it.

02:23.000 --> 02:26.000
And then by using that function we will change that state everywhere.

02:26.000 --> 02:28.000
How to do that?

02:28.000 --> 02:30.000
That I will show you now.

02:30.000 --> 02:33.000
Now I will show you how we can do that thing.

02:33.000 --> 02:36.000
So first of all we will go to our app.tsx.

02:36.000 --> 02:37.000
Ok.

02:37.000 --> 02:39.000
What have we used in app.tsx?

02:39.000 --> 02:42.000
We have used header in app.tsx.

02:42.000 --> 02:43.000
So now what will we do here?

02:43.000 --> 02:45.000
You just keep watching.

02:45.000 --> 02:49.000
First of all we will make a state here.

02:49.000 --> 02:51.000
We will name the state as current status.

02:53.000 --> 02:57.000
And here we will name it as set current status.

02:57.000 --> 03:01.000
So we have made this state.

03:01.000 --> 03:04.000
Where we have set status and current status.

03:04.000 --> 03:09.000
In this by default message will be welcome.

03:09.000 --> 03:11.000
I will tell you all this properly.

03:11.000 --> 03:13.000
That what is this?

03:13.000 --> 03:17.000
So here by default message that we have put is welcome.

03:17.000 --> 03:19.000
Now what we will do?

03:19.000 --> 03:22.000
That our status and current status.

03:22.000 --> 03:24.000
This is our current status.

03:24.000 --> 03:26.000
We will pass this to header.

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
So now what will we do in header?

03:28.000 --> 03:31.000
Whatever we have put here as current status.

03:31.000 --> 03:32.000
Current status.

03:32.000 --> 03:34.000
Here we will make a prop.

03:34.000 --> 03:38.000
Current status.

03:38.000 --> 03:40.000
Ok.

03:40.000 --> 03:43.000
And after that we will pass this from here.

03:43.000 --> 03:48.000
Is equals to current status.

03:48.000 --> 03:51.000
Ok.

03:51.000 --> 03:52.000
Ok.

03:52.000 --> 03:55.000
So this is our current status whatever it is.

03:55.000 --> 03:56.000
Now.

03:56.000 --> 03:58.000
Now here we have done current status.

03:58.000 --> 04:00.000
But by default it will also go as welcome value.

04:00.000 --> 04:02.000
Here we have to change it also.

04:02.000 --> 04:03.000
So now what we will do?

04:03.000 --> 04:06.000
We will make a function.

04:06.000 --> 04:11.000
And we will name this term as handle status.

04:11.000 --> 04:14.000
This will be carrow function.

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
And there is nothing in this.

04:16.000 --> 04:19.000
We will just use set current status.

04:19.000 --> 04:20.000
And in it.

04:20.000 --> 04:22.000
And in it we will set a value.

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000
So here we used to pass a parameter by doing status.

04:24.000 --> 04:28.000
By doing status.

04:28.000 --> 04:31.000
And we will put it in this.

04:31.000 --> 04:34.000
Now what will happen?

04:34.000 --> 04:36.000
Once you understand it properly.

04:36.000 --> 04:38.000
What we did in the beginning?

04:38.000 --> 04:39.000
We made a basic state.

04:39.000 --> 04:40.000
Now what was happening?

04:40.000 --> 04:43.000
That we are using header in app.tsx.

04:43.000 --> 04:47.000
So through popup we could not set it.

04:47.000 --> 04:49.000
Whatever above parameter and value can be.

04:49.000 --> 04:51.000
We could not set it here.

04:51.000 --> 04:53.000
Because we have not used header here.

04:53.000 --> 04:55.000
Now when we have not used header.

04:55.000 --> 04:57.000
Then we could not call header here.

04:57.000 --> 04:59.000
And through it we could not pass props.

04:59.000 --> 05:01.000
So now what we did?

05:01.000 --> 05:04.000
That in our app.tsx where we used header.

05:04.000 --> 05:06.000
There we made a state.

05:06.000 --> 05:07.000
And after that.

05:07.000 --> 05:11.000
We set the default value of that state as welcome.

05:11.000 --> 05:14.000
Second thing we made a function here.

05:14.000 --> 05:15.000
And what we did?

05:15.000 --> 05:17.000
That the current status.

05:17.000 --> 05:19.000
In our app.tsx.

05:19.000 --> 05:21.000
Basically we passed the prop.

05:21.000 --> 05:23.000
Which we made a state here.

05:23.000 --> 05:24.000
Now what we will do?

05:24.000 --> 05:25.000
That the function we made here.

05:25.000 --> 05:26.000
Of handle status.

05:26.000 --> 05:28.000
Now we will pass it in popup.

05:28.000 --> 05:29.000
Means.

05:29.000 --> 05:35.000
Now we will pass handle status in popup.

05:35.000 --> 05:39.000
Now we have put the function in popup.

05:39.000 --> 05:42.000
Now in popup also we accept a prop.

05:42.000 --> 05:45.000
So here we will accept handle status.

05:45.000 --> 05:46.000
Now what will we do here?

05:46.000 --> 05:47.000
See this.

05:47.000 --> 05:49.000
We made handle status function.

05:49.000 --> 05:51.000
And sent it in popup.

05:51.000 --> 05:52.000
Now what we will do?

05:52.000 --> 05:54.000
That we will call handle status function.

05:54.000 --> 05:56.000
And in it.

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
We will set any value.

05:58.000 --> 06:00.000
So it will come here in state and set.

06:00.000 --> 06:02.000
Here we have put a parameter.

06:02.000 --> 06:04.000
Now whatever value will come in place of this parameter.

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
It will come in set current status.

06:06.000 --> 06:09.000
And this current status will be replaced by that.

06:09.000 --> 06:11.000
You must have understood what I said.

06:11.000 --> 06:12.000
And now we will do it further.

06:12.000 --> 06:13.000
So you will understand better.

06:13.000 --> 06:14.000
So what we did?

06:14.000 --> 06:15.000
That we made a function.

06:15.000 --> 06:16.000
We made a function.

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
And we passed it in popup.

06:18.000 --> 06:19.000
Basically.

06:19.000 --> 06:22.000
We put handle status function in popup.

06:22.000 --> 06:24.000
Now from popup we will access this function.

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
And whatever value we will set in it.

06:26.000 --> 06:29.000
Whatever value we will pass through it in the type of call.

06:29.000 --> 06:31.000
Whatever argument we will pass.

06:31.000 --> 06:33.000
It will be set in state there.

06:33.000 --> 06:36.000
And as soon as this value is set in state.

06:36.000 --> 06:39.000
So this value will come in header.

06:39.000 --> 06:40.000
So now what will we do?

06:40.000 --> 06:43.000
That here we will set handle status.

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
With arguments.

06:45.000 --> 06:50.000
That means whatever argument we will pass in handle status.

06:50.000 --> 06:53.000
It will be set in our current status.

06:53.000 --> 06:54.000
So now we will go down.

06:54.000 --> 06:57.000
And first of all we will set here for analyzing.

06:57.000 --> 07:00.000
That when content is being analyzed.

07:00.000 --> 07:01.000
So what will happen?

07:01.000 --> 07:03.000
That the summarized function you are seeing.

07:03.000 --> 07:05.000
As soon as someone clicks on the button.

07:05.000 --> 07:06.000
On the image.

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
Then summarized function is called.

07:08.000 --> 07:10.000
So as soon as summarized function is called.

07:10.000 --> 07:11.000
What does it do?

07:11.000 --> 07:12.000
First of all it scrapes.

07:12.000 --> 07:13.000
Right.

07:13.000 --> 07:15.000
First of all it scrapes.

07:15.000 --> 07:17.000
After scraping it ends the message.

07:17.000 --> 07:18.000
In the background.

07:18.000 --> 07:21.000
And the content in the background is analyzed.

07:21.000 --> 07:23.000
So we just have to do this thing.

07:23.000 --> 07:26.000
Now here the scraping is done in real time.

07:26.000 --> 07:27.000
As soon as you click.

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
The scraping starts.

07:29.000 --> 07:30.000
Sorry it ends.

07:30.000 --> 07:31.000
It starts and ends too.

07:31.000 --> 07:32.000
That means in single click.

07:32.000 --> 07:35.000
It immediately scrapes the content in real time.

07:35.000 --> 07:37.000
So when will it be summarized?

07:37.000 --> 07:40.000
As soon as someone clicks on the button.

07:40.000 --> 07:43.000
So the content is scraped in real time.

07:43.000 --> 07:45.000
So the content is scraped as soon as you click.

07:45.000 --> 07:47.000
But after some time.

07:47.000 --> 07:49.000
After some milliseconds.

07:49.000 --> 07:51.000
The analyzing should be written on top.

07:51.000 --> 07:52.000
So now what will we do?

07:52.000 --> 07:53.000
You just understand this much.

07:53.000 --> 07:55.000
That as soon as the user clicks on the button.

07:55.000 --> 07:57.000
Then the analyzing will be written on top.

07:57.000 --> 07:59.000
Now how will the analyzing be written?

07:59.000 --> 08:00.000
Our handle status function.

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
Which we have brought on top here.

08:02.000 --> 08:03.000
Through the prop.

08:03.000 --> 08:04.000
Received.

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
We will set through it.

08:06.000 --> 08:07.000
So what will we do?

08:07.000 --> 08:09.000
What do we do here in the summarize?

08:10.000 --> 08:12.000
We call the handle status function.

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
The status parameter in it.

08:14.000 --> 08:16.000
We give it an argument.

08:16.000 --> 08:19.000
And write analyzing here.

08:19.000 --> 08:21.000
Analyzing.

08:21.000 --> 08:23.000
And three dots.

08:23.000 --> 08:24.000
This is our analyzing.

08:24.000 --> 08:25.000
So now what will happen?

08:25.000 --> 08:27.000
This is our app.tsx.

08:27.000 --> 08:28.000
Here now.

08:28.000 --> 08:30.000
In the beginning, welcome will be written.

08:30.000 --> 08:31.000
Okay.

08:31.000 --> 08:33.000
In the beginning, welcome will be written.

08:33.000 --> 08:34.000
But as soon as.

08:34.000 --> 08:37.000
Here now we have sent the handle status in the pop-up.

08:37.000 --> 08:39.000
Now as soon as the user clicks on the button.

08:39.000 --> 08:41.000
So we have put analyzing in the handle status.

08:41.000 --> 08:43.000
And this is the analyzing.

08:43.000 --> 08:45.000
It will go to your app.

08:45.000 --> 08:47.000
And here it will set the value.

08:47.000 --> 08:49.000
Here the value of analyzing.

08:49.000 --> 08:51.000
It will be set here.

08:51.000 --> 08:53.000
And your current status will be analyzed.

08:53.000 --> 08:55.000
You must be able to understand.

08:55.000 --> 08:57.000
So here the analyzing is done.

08:57.000 --> 08:59.000
Now after this the last thing happens.

08:59.000 --> 09:00.000
That is summary.

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
Analyzed.

09:02.000 --> 09:03.000
Welcome came.

09:03.000 --> 09:05.000
Now when the summary will be shown at the end.

09:05.000 --> 09:07.000
So write the summary at the top.

09:07.000 --> 09:08.000
So what will you do for that?

09:08.000 --> 09:09.000
Here you will write here.

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000
If summary dot length greater than zero.

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
Which we had done here before.

09:13.000 --> 09:14.000
Here now what we will do here.

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
Handle status.

09:16.000 --> 09:20.000
Here now we will call handle status.

09:20.000 --> 09:21.000
Handle status.

09:21.000 --> 09:23.000
And in this now we will set.

09:23.000 --> 09:25.000
Summary string.

09:25.000 --> 09:27.000
So as soon as.

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
Summary's length which is greater than zero.

09:29.000 --> 09:30.000
It is found.

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
So here that particular.

09:32.000 --> 09:33.000
Our.

09:33.000 --> 09:34.000
String is.

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
The status is.

09:36.000 --> 09:37.000
Summary sets it.

09:38.000 --> 09:41.000
So we have done all these things here.

09:41.000 --> 09:43.000
Let's save the header once.

09:43.000 --> 09:45.000
You have to save all the files.

09:45.000 --> 09:46.000
So now what is happening.

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
Let's understand its flow quickly.

09:48.000 --> 09:51.000
Our header was in app dot tsx.

09:51.000 --> 09:52.000
Now in the header.

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
We had to put the value of status.

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
That what is going on with current status.

09:56.000 --> 09:57.000
For this, all the value of status.

09:57.000 --> 09:59.000
It was in the pop-up.

09:59.000 --> 10:01.000
And we had to give it to the header through pop-up.

10:01.000 --> 10:04.000
But we were not using the header in the pop-up.

10:04.000 --> 10:05.000
So what did we do?

10:05.000 --> 10:07.000
That here we made a function in app dot tsx.

10:07.000 --> 10:09.000
And made a state.

10:09.000 --> 10:12.000
We passed this function in the pop-up.

10:12.000 --> 10:13.000
And through pop-up.

10:13.000 --> 10:16.000
We set the value in the state.

10:16.000 --> 10:19.000
And we directly sent that state in the header.

10:19.000 --> 10:20.000
So we didn't do much.

10:20.000 --> 10:21.000
First of all.

10:21.000 --> 10:22.000
We made a function.

10:22.000 --> 10:23.000
Made a state.

10:23.000 --> 10:24.000
Sent it in the pop-up.

10:24.000 --> 10:25.000
Second thing.

10:25.000 --> 10:27.000
Set the value in the pop-up.

10:27.000 --> 10:28.000
Third thing.

10:28.000 --> 10:31.000
Sent the same value set in the header.

10:31.000 --> 10:32.000
Simple.

10:32.000 --> 10:35.000
So we used some callback functions.

10:35.000 --> 10:36.000
We did all these things.

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
We did all these things.

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
Now what do we do?

10:40.000 --> 10:43.000
Now we go to our page once.

10:43.000 --> 10:46.000
And here we.

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
Now let's check the extension once.

10:48.000 --> 10:50.000
We went to extension.

10:50.000 --> 10:53.000
And here as soon as we click on extension.

10:53.000 --> 10:56.000
So look above gave analyzing.

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
And as soon as the summary will be loaded.

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
Same way what will be written above.

11:00.000 --> 11:01.000
Summary.

11:01.000 --> 11:03.000
So let's see once now.

11:03.000 --> 11:04.000
So here the summary is come.

11:04.000 --> 11:05.000
And see the summary was written at the top.

11:05.000 --> 11:12.620
summary will be written here, so you understood that here you are the particular states or props

11:12.620 --> 11:20.540
that you can pass even such contents from such a place, which is not directly accessible,

11:20.540 --> 11:30.620
so you can pass them in this way, so finally our extension is complete, here we have told you everything

11:30.620 --> 11:36.920
that how the summary will come, all the things have been made, now you try it from your end,

11:36.920 --> 11:42.020
summarize a lot of content and try to add something from yourself in it
