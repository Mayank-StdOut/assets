WEBVTT

00:06.000 --> 00:15.000
So, till now we have seen how we made the search box, after that we implemented the search and we locked the search data in the console.

00:15.000 --> 00:21.000
Now, the second thing is that we will have to show the search result somewhere, so where will we show it?

00:21.000 --> 00:24.000
So, for this, we will make a new component.

00:24.000 --> 00:34.000
So, as you know, what is a component? A component is basically a part of your website which is used as a component in react.

00:34.000 --> 00:39.000
So, we will make a component in which we will show the results.

00:39.000 --> 00:42.000
So, what you have to do to make a component? You have to click on the source folder.

00:42.000 --> 00:50.000
There you have to make a new file by doing movie card and in this movie card component, we will show our results.

00:50.000 --> 00:54.000
Remember, whenever you make a component, its name should start with capital letter.

00:54.000 --> 01:00.000
Because in react, before making any component, you have to keep its name on capital letter only.

01:00.000 --> 01:08.000
After this, now what will you do here? First of all, we will use a shortcut whose name is rafce.

01:08.000 --> 01:17.000
Now, let's do this. So, you don't have to make the above code, the function to be made, the callback arrow function.

01:17.000 --> 01:20.000
See, you have generated everything by yourself and got it.

01:20.000 --> 01:23.000
You just have to start writing from here, from the inside of the return.

01:23.000 --> 01:26.000
So, this div, we will give it a class name.

01:26.000 --> 01:29.000
And the class name, we will name it movie.

01:29.000 --> 01:33.000
Now, what will we show in this div?

01:33.000 --> 01:40.000
In this, we want to show the year of the movie, the data which we are getting from our API.

01:40.000 --> 01:43.000
So, for that, we will do one thing. Here, we will make a div again.

01:43.000 --> 01:47.000
And in this div, if you see, as you wrote div here.

01:47.000 --> 01:52.000
I will tell you one more thing. When you wrote div here and hit enter, then it did not come as a div by itself.

01:53.000 --> 02:02.000
This happened because here, your language set is only javascript set.

02:02.000 --> 02:06.000
And we are using javascript as a javascript jsx here.

02:06.000 --> 02:08.000
So, we have to set the jsx.

02:08.000 --> 02:10.000
So, what will we do for this?

02:10.000 --> 02:17.000
Here, you will see at the bottom, at the bottom of your vs code, in the bottom right, you will write javascript.

02:17.000 --> 02:18.000
You have to click on it.

02:18.000 --> 02:20.000
And this search will open at the top.

02:20.000 --> 02:21.000
Select language mode.

02:21.000 --> 02:22.000
Here you have to write jsx.

02:22.000 --> 02:24.000
And you have to hit enter.

02:24.000 --> 02:26.000
After this, you will be able to use shortcuts here.

02:26.000 --> 02:30.000
So, as soon as you write div and hit enter, it will automatically become a div.

02:30.000 --> 02:31.000
Okay.

02:31.000 --> 02:34.000
So, first, we have to put a paragraph in this div.

02:34.000 --> 02:35.000
What will we show here in paragraph?

02:35.000 --> 02:38.000
Here, we will show the year of the movie.

02:38.000 --> 02:39.000
We will show the year of the movie here.

02:39.000 --> 02:42.000
So, we make a bracket here.

02:42.000 --> 02:48.000
So, the thing to know here is that we are getting all this data in app.js.

02:48.000 --> 02:49.000
Here.

02:49.000 --> 02:51.000
I mean, we are getting all the data here.

02:51.000 --> 02:52.000
This.

02:52.000 --> 02:53.000
This is all the data.

02:53.000 --> 02:58.000
So, how do we take this data from here to the movie card?

02:58.000 --> 03:03.000
So, now we will know about the second thing here, which is react props.

03:03.000 --> 03:05.000
What do props do?

03:05.000 --> 03:09.000
Props are basically used to pass data.

03:09.000 --> 03:12.000
You can send data from one component to another component.

03:12.000 --> 03:14.000
So, you send using props.

03:14.000 --> 03:15.000
How is that?

03:15.000 --> 03:20.000
To send data to the movie card, you will have to import the movie card first and bring it to app.js.

03:20.000 --> 03:21.000
So, what will you do?

03:21.000 --> 03:23.000
You will import the movie card.

03:23.000 --> 03:24.000
So, here you have imported the movie card.

03:24.000 --> 03:26.000
After that, you have to go to the bottom.

03:26.000 --> 03:33.000
And you have to place the movie card just below this div of yours, your search div.

03:33.000 --> 03:36.000
So, for this, you will write the movie card.

03:36.000 --> 03:43.000
And if you will type forward slash and press enter, then it will automatically put angular brackets.

03:43.000 --> 03:45.000
So, this is how you import a component.

03:45.000 --> 03:46.000
So, what will happen now?

03:46.000 --> 03:47.000
You will see the search above.

03:47.000 --> 03:48.000
Just you have to import the movie card.

03:48.000 --> 03:49.000
What will you do now?

03:49.000 --> 03:52.000
you will see the movie card component in the website.

03:52.000 --> 03:55.000
So, both these things will be rendered.

03:55.000 --> 03:58.000
So, you don't have to code the movie card code below.

03:58.000 --> 04:01.000
This is the beauty of React.

04:01.000 --> 04:04.000
You made the movie card as a component

04:04.000 --> 04:07.000
and you can call that component in any code

04:07.000 --> 04:10.000
and render it there.

04:10.000 --> 04:13.000
After this, what we wanted

04:13.000 --> 04:16.000
is that the data should be sent from the movie card

04:16.000 --> 04:19.000
to the movie card.

04:19.000 --> 04:22.000
So, for this,

04:22.000 --> 04:25.000
we will use props.

04:25.000 --> 04:28.000
To use props,

04:28.000 --> 04:31.000
go to the parent component.

04:31.000 --> 04:34.000
The parent component is the movie card.

04:34.000 --> 04:37.000
The movie card is the main component.

04:37.000 --> 04:40.000
This is basically the child component.

04:40.000 --> 04:43.000
Don't understand this.

04:43.000 --> 04:46.000
You have to write movie at the top.

04:46.000 --> 04:49.000
We need a data from the name of the movie.

04:49.000 --> 04:52.000
For that, write movie

04:52.000 --> 04:55.000
and put brackets here.

04:55.000 --> 04:58.000
Now, go to app.js

04:58.000 --> 05:01.000
and in the movie card,

05:01.000 --> 05:04.000
write movie

05:04.000 --> 05:07.000
and equals to

05:07.000 --> 05:10.000
the data of the movie.

05:10.000 --> 05:13.000
We will send it here.

05:13.000 --> 05:16.000
But before that, we have to keep one more thing in mind.

05:16.000 --> 05:19.000
The data of the movie

05:19.000 --> 05:22.000
has a lot of movies in it.

05:22.000 --> 05:23.000
Not just one movie.

05:23.000 --> 05:25.000
List of 10 movies.

05:25.000 --> 05:27.000
There are a lot of movies in it.

05:27.000 --> 05:30.000
So, we have to show the movies one by one.

05:30.000 --> 05:31.000
Now, what we will do is

05:31.000 --> 05:33.000
we will use a thing here

05:33.000 --> 05:35.000
which we call map function.

05:35.000 --> 05:37.000
What map function does is

05:37.000 --> 05:40.000
it will take out one movie from the 10 movies

05:40.000 --> 05:43.000
and send it to the movie card.

05:43.000 --> 05:45.000
And it will be rendered every movie.

05:45.000 --> 05:47.000
Not just one movie.

05:47.000 --> 05:50.000
Every movie will be rendered in the page.

05:50.000 --> 05:52.000
And before that, we have to do one more thing.

05:52.000 --> 05:54.000
We have to see this.

05:54.000 --> 05:56.000
For example, we search a movie

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
which does not exist.

05:58.000 --> 06:00.000
So, in that, our API

06:00.000 --> 06:02.000
will not give us anything in the result.

06:02.000 --> 06:04.000
It will give an empty result.

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
So, first we have to check

06:06.000 --> 06:08.000
whether our result is empty or not.

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
If our result is empty,

06:10.000 --> 06:12.000
then we will show

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
no movies found.

06:14.000 --> 06:17.000
But if our result has movies,

06:17.000 --> 06:19.000
if our data has movies,

06:19.000 --> 06:21.000
then we will show them movies.

06:21.000 --> 06:23.000
So, for this, what you have to do is

06:23.000 --> 06:26.000
you have to define some conditions here.

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
How to define conditions?

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
First of all, you will put brackets here.

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
Because in these brackets,

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
we will write the logic of JavaScript.

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
So, here we write movies

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
and here we put question mark

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
dot length

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
greater than zero.

06:42.000 --> 06:44.000
So,

06:44.000 --> 06:46.000
what is happening here?

06:46.000 --> 06:48.000
Now, here we are saying

06:48.000 --> 06:50.000
that the array called movies

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
which we have seen,

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
which we have shown in the console,

06:54.000 --> 06:56.000
that array,

06:56.000 --> 06:58.000
is it empty?

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
If it is empty,

07:00.000 --> 07:02.000
then we will show that movies are not there.

07:02.000 --> 07:04.000
But if it is not empty,

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
then we have to show this movie card component.

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
So, now let's assume that

07:08.000 --> 07:10.000
it has movies in it.

07:10.000 --> 07:12.000
So, for that, we write conditions.

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
If there is a movie in that data,

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
then we will show

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
this movie card component.

07:18.000 --> 07:20.000
So, for this, what you have to do is

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
you have to write this thing.

07:22.000 --> 07:24.000
After this, what you have to do is

07:24.000 --> 07:26.000
you have to put this open and close parenthesis

07:26.000 --> 07:28.000
here and

07:28.000 --> 07:30.000
you have to put this movie card

07:30.000 --> 07:32.000
in it.

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
So, now what we have said here

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000
and after this, you have to put

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
a colon here.

07:40.000 --> 07:42.000
After putting a colon, what you have to do is

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
you have to make a div.

07:44.000 --> 07:46.000
You have to show the div to the user

07:46.000 --> 07:48.000
in which it will be written movie not found.

07:48.000 --> 07:50.000
So, we will make a div here

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
and the name of the div will be

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
empty.

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
And the div class will be empty

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
and we will put an h2 tag in it.

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
And in the h2 tag,

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
we will write no movies found.

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
By saying no movies found.

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
So, what will happen now?

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
If we get the movies,

08:10.000 --> 08:12.000
then it will show the movie card,

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
if we don't get the movie card,

08:14.000 --> 08:16.000
then it will show the movie card.

08:16.000 --> 08:18.000
But one more thing,

08:18.000 --> 08:20.000
you have to see the syntax

08:20.000 --> 08:22.000
of this once,

08:22.000 --> 08:24.000
that how we have defined the conditions.

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
So, what have we done?

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
Let me explain you one more time.

08:28.000 --> 08:30.000
We have put curly braces here.

08:30.000 --> 08:32.000
In this, we have written our condition.

08:32.000 --> 08:34.000
That condition can be any of us.

08:34.000 --> 08:36.000
Here I will write

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
any condition to you.

08:38.000 --> 08:40.000
Like if movies length

08:40.000 --> 08:42.000
Here I have written to explain you.

08:42.000 --> 08:44.000
Movies length

08:44.000 --> 08:46.000
or if condition

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
any of your if condition.

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
If condition

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
then question mark

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
do this

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
else

08:56.000 --> 08:58.000
do this

08:58.000 --> 09:00.000
So, here

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
from this comment,

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
you must be able to understand

09:04.000 --> 09:06.000
that if this is the if condition

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
if it is true

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
then you have to do this

09:10.000 --> 09:12.000
or you have to do this.

09:12.000 --> 09:14.000
Same thing we have done below

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
that if this condition is true

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
then you have to show movies card

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
or else you have to show

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
this portion below.

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
Okay, so hope you have understood this.

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
After this,

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
the second thing is

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
that now as we have discussed

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
that here in movies

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
not one but 10 movies data is coming

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
but we have to show

09:36.000 --> 09:38.000
the data of the user one by one.

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
We cannot show the data of the movie

09:40.000 --> 09:42.000
in one card only.

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
So, for this

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
we will extract the data of the movie one by one.

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
For this we will use the map function.

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
For this we will use the map function.

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
So, for this we will remove the movie card

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
and make a div in it

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
first of all.

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
And the class of div

09:58.000 --> 10:00.000
we give is container class.

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
And in this

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
we will use our map function.

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
So, for this we will

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
open a curly bracket again.

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
Here we write that in which map function

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
we have to run the map function.

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
We have to run the map function in the array named movies.

10:14.000 --> 10:16.000
So, we will write movies.map

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
After this,

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
what name will you give to the movies

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
which are coming out of it one by one?

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
Movies is our entire array.

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
But the one which is coming out of

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
one by one,

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
we will know it by the name of movie.

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
Okay, in movies

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
we are extracting movies one by one.

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
After this what we have to do?

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
One more thing,

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
the syntax is of this type.

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
So, you have to open two brackets.

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
And here you have to

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
make an arrow function.

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
And after this

10:48.000 --> 10:50.000
you have to take parentheses again.

10:50.000 --> 10:52.000
And in parentheses

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
you have to

10:54.000 --> 10:56.000
render the movie card

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
here.

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
After this

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
you have to send

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
movie through the

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
prop.

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
We will understand it one more time.

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
See what happened.

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
We extracted

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000
one movie from the array of movies.

11:14.000 --> 11:16.000
We named it movie.

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
We are calling every movie a movie.

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
Now in the movie card component

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
we have passed

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
a prop named movie.

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
We said

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
we want the details of every movie here.

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
So, we

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
named it movie and said

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
we want the details of every movie.

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
So, we said okay,

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
we are asking for the details

11:38.000 --> 11:40.000
and we will

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
set the variable of

11:42.000 --> 11:44.000
the movie here.

11:44.000 --> 11:46.000
So, this data

11:46.000 --> 11:48.000
now will pass in the movie card.

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
So, we will save it first.

11:50.000 --> 11:52.000
Now we will go to the movie card.

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
After going to the movie card

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
now what we do is

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
we render each data.

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
So, in this

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
we will see

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
the movie.er data.

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
The data

12:06.000 --> 12:11.500
The second data is that of the image, the poster data of a movie.

12:11.500 --> 12:14.000
We will put an image tag for that.

12:14.000 --> 12:15.500
What will we write in the source?

12:15.500 --> 12:19.000
In the source, we will write movie dot.

12:19.000 --> 12:20.500
Why are we writing movie dot?

12:20.500 --> 12:22.500
Because movie is an object.

12:22.500 --> 12:24.500
It has a data named year.

12:24.500 --> 12:29.000
It has a data named poster in which the movie's photo is.

12:29.000 --> 12:31.500
Now we will put a condition in this too.

12:31.500 --> 12:37.000
We will say that if movie poster, who knows, some movie posters are not there.

12:37.000 --> 12:38.500
There is a very old movie.

12:38.500 --> 12:40.000
We did not get its image.

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
So we will put a condition here too.

12:42.000 --> 12:46.500
If the poster of the movie has the value of n a.

12:46.500 --> 12:47.500
n slash a.

12:47.500 --> 12:49.500
This means if the movie poster is not there.

12:49.500 --> 12:51.500
So what do you have to show here?

12:51.500 --> 12:53.500
So you have to show here.

12:53.500 --> 12:58.000
You have to show a placeholder.

12:58.000 --> 13:01.000
What do you have to show in movie dot poster?

13:01.000 --> 13:08.000
You have to show something in movie dot poster.

13:08.000 --> 13:09.000
This is our link.

13:09.000 --> 13:22.000
https sorry via dot placeholder dot com slash 404.

13:22.000 --> 13:25.000
So this will show us a photo of a placeholder.

13:25.000 --> 13:28.000
If we do not get the photo of the movie.

13:28.000 --> 13:29.000
Sorry 400.

13:29.000 --> 13:31.000
400 means 400 by 400.

13:31.000 --> 13:33.000
We will show a placeholder.

13:33.000 --> 13:34.000
Then we will put an alt.

13:34.000 --> 13:39.000
And the name of the alt will be movie dot title.

13:39.000 --> 13:41.000
We are getting all this data from the object.

13:41.000 --> 13:44.000
That was the object of our API.

13:44.000 --> 13:45.000
Okay.

13:45.000 --> 13:47.000
So you must have understood this condition.

13:47.000 --> 13:50.000
You must have understood the condition here.

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
After this.

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
The third thing we need.

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
What do we need?

13:56.000 --> 13:59.000
We need the type of our movie.

13:59.000 --> 14:01.000
So what is the type of the movie?

14:01.000 --> 14:03.000
So here we have div.

14:03.000 --> 14:05.000
And in this we will render the type of the movie.

14:05.000 --> 14:06.000
In this we will use expand tag.

14:06.000 --> 14:12.000
In this we will put movie dot type.

14:12.000 --> 14:14.000
And we will close this.

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
Then after this we will put the third thing.

14:16.000 --> 14:17.000
That will be one.

14:17.000 --> 14:18.000
Head tag.

14:18.000 --> 14:24.000
In which we will show the title of the movie.

14:24.000 --> 14:29.000
The title of the movie.

14:29.000 --> 14:32.000
So these things we have to show in our movie card.

14:32.000 --> 14:34.000
We will show the year of the movie.

14:34.000 --> 14:35.000
The image of the movie.

14:35.000 --> 14:36.000
The type of the movie.

14:36.000 --> 14:37.000
And the title of the movie.

14:37.000 --> 14:40.000
So after this we have to do one more thing.

14:40.000 --> 14:46.000
We will go to app dot js.

14:46.000 --> 14:51.000
And finally we have to set the data of the movie.

14:51.000 --> 14:53.000
What was happening till now?

14:53.000 --> 14:55.000
That the data coming from the API.

14:55.000 --> 14:57.000
What was happening directly?

14:57.000 --> 14:58.000
It was being printed on the web page.

14:59.000 --> 15:01.000
Or sorry in the console.

15:01.000 --> 15:03.000
Directly it was being printed on the console.

15:03.000 --> 15:07.000
So now we have to set the data which is being printed.

15:07.000 --> 15:11.000
We have to set it in the set movies state.

15:11.000 --> 15:12.000
So for that what we will do?

15:12.000 --> 15:14.000
We will go here.

15:14.000 --> 15:16.000
And here we will do set movies.

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
And in this we will set the data.

15:18.000 --> 15:19.000
Ok.

15:19.000 --> 15:22.000
But before this one more thing.

15:22.000 --> 15:26.000
We will not be able to see the data of the movie.

15:26.000 --> 15:27.000
Why we will not be able to see?

15:27.000 --> 15:29.000
Let us go to chrome and see.

15:29.000 --> 15:31.000
We will come to our chrome.

15:31.000 --> 15:34.000
And here you will see one thing.

15:34.000 --> 15:37.000
Here I will open the inspect element.

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
And here I will go to the console.

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
For now there are many errors here.

15:41.000 --> 15:42.000
So I will remove it.

15:42.000 --> 15:45.000
Ok.

15:45.000 --> 15:48.000
After this here I will search any movie.

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
For example I will search something else.

15:50.000 --> 15:52.000
Here I will search Spiderman.

15:52.000 --> 15:55.000
And here I will search it.

15:55.000 --> 15:56.000
As soon as I search here.

15:56.000 --> 15:57.000
See the array came.

15:57.000 --> 15:58.000
Now when you click on it.

15:58.000 --> 15:59.000
When you click on it.

15:59.000 --> 16:00.000
Then you will see.

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
That in this array.

16:02.000 --> 16:03.000
In this search array.

16:03.000 --> 16:05.000
In this object.

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
There are many things in it.

16:07.000 --> 16:08.000
There is response.

16:08.000 --> 16:09.000
There is total result.

16:09.000 --> 16:12.000
But we don't care about response and total result.

16:12.000 --> 16:16.000
We need this search array in this search.

16:16.000 --> 16:18.000
So we need this particular thing.

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
And then we need all the things in it.

16:20.000 --> 16:23.000
So we don't care about response and length.

16:23.000 --> 16:24.000
So what we have to do?

16:24.000 --> 16:26.000
We have to come back to our code.

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
And after coming back to the code.

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
We just need that search array.

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
So here we will search data dot.

16:32.000 --> 16:35.000
So that we get only that meaning.

16:35.000 --> 16:36.000
Which we need.

16:36.000 --> 16:37.000
Ok.

16:37.000 --> 16:39.000
So you were able to see till now.

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
That the data which is showing here.

16:41.000 --> 16:42.000
That was not happening.

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
Let me show you here.

16:44.000 --> 16:45.000
So you were able to see.

16:45.000 --> 16:47.000
That data was not showing here.

16:47.000 --> 16:48.000
That's why it was not happening.

16:48.000 --> 16:52.000
Because we were fetching all the objects.

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
And our code was confused.

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
So because of this it was not happening.

16:56.000 --> 16:57.000
But now see.

16:57.000 --> 16:59.000
Now I will search it again.

16:59.000 --> 17:01.000
And as soon as I search.

17:01.000 --> 17:03.000
All the movies have come down.

17:03.000 --> 17:05.000
See this.

17:05.000 --> 17:11.000
So all these movies have come down.

17:11.000 --> 17:14.000
So finally you have understood here.

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
How to call API.

17:16.000 --> 17:17.000
How to search.

17:17.000 --> 17:18.000
And how to show it.

17:18.000 --> 17:19.000
You understood components.

17:19.000 --> 17:20.000
You understood props.

17:20.000 --> 17:22.000
You understood map function.

17:22.000 --> 17:24.000
So all these things which are coming here.

17:24.000 --> 17:25.000
All the styles in it.

17:25.000 --> 17:26.000
All these.

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
All these styles which we have put in CSS.

17:28.000 --> 17:29.000
All these styles which we have put in CSS.

17:29.000 --> 17:30.000
All these styles which we have put in CSS.

17:30.000 --> 17:31.000
See this.

17:31.000 --> 17:32.000
So what we did there.

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
We put the type of movie there.

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
So this type is movie only.

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
Here we put movie.year.

17:38.000 --> 17:39.000
You will remember.

17:39.000 --> 17:40.000
After this this is movie poster.

17:40.000 --> 17:42.000
And this is movie name.

17:42.000 --> 17:46.000
So we have understood this here.

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
Now after this what we will be making.

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
That will be a Krausel.

17:50.000 --> 17:51.000
So we are understanding Krausel.

17:51.000 --> 17:52.000
And we will be making.

17:52.000 --> 17:53.000
After this.
