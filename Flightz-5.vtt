WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:10.000
So, now we will make a header, a header component.

00:10.000 --> 00:15.000
So, for the header component, which we also call navbar, we will go to the source folder

00:15.000 --> 00:23.000
and again go to the components and make a new component named navbar.jsx.

00:23.000 --> 00:27.000
So, we will make a component named navbar.

00:27.000 --> 00:31.000
Now, sorry, I have done the naqbar by mistake, so I will rename it again.

00:31.000 --> 00:33.000
So, this is navbar, okay.

00:33.000 --> 00:38.000
Now, from here, you will have to do rafce, you will have to run the command there.

00:38.000 --> 00:46.000
After this, what you will have to do is, here in navbar, first of all, we will use the tag named header.

00:46.000 --> 00:50.000
So, first of all, we will come here and use the tag named header.

00:50.000 --> 00:53.000
Before that, we will select the language here, jsx.

00:53.000 --> 00:56.000
So, you know the way to select the language.

00:56.000 --> 00:57.000
So, you know the way to select the language.

00:57.000 --> 00:59.000
Now, in the right corner, you will have to type javascript.

00:59.000 --> 01:01.000
You have to click on that and type jsx.

01:01.000 --> 01:04.000
You will write header and enter, so the header tag will be created.

01:04.000 --> 01:06.000
In this, we will bring another tag named nav.

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
We will use the tag named nav.

01:08.000 --> 01:11.000
We will give it a class name, navbar.

01:11.000 --> 01:13.000
We will enter.

01:13.000 --> 01:15.000
Now, there will be two things in navbar.

01:15.000 --> 01:19.000
The first will be logo and the second will be a link named home.

01:21.000 --> 01:25.000
So, we will do image and we will give its class name logo.

01:25.000 --> 01:26.000
And we will give it image source.

01:26.000 --> 01:33.000
So, image source will be our logo which we will provide in the links.

01:33.000 --> 01:35.000
So, you have to use that image source.

01:35.000 --> 01:38.000
And we will give it a name on the logo.

01:38.000 --> 01:40.000
So, we will enter its source later.

01:40.000 --> 01:44.000
After that, we have to create an unordered list.

01:44.000 --> 01:46.000
And we have to give its class name navlinks.

01:50.000 --> 01:53.000
We have to create a list element in it.

01:53.000 --> 01:55.000
And we have to enter anchor tag in it.

01:55.000 --> 01:58.000
Anchor tag means link tag.

01:59.000 --> 02:02.000
And href will be forward slash.

02:02.000 --> 02:05.000
Because this link tag is representing home only.

02:05.000 --> 02:07.000
So, basically we will give the link of home.

02:08.000 --> 02:09.000
So, we have done nothing.

02:09.000 --> 02:10.000
We have put the logo here.

02:10.000 --> 02:12.000
After that, we have put a link.

02:12.000 --> 02:15.000
To click on it, the user will come to the top.

02:15.000 --> 02:17.000
Means, it will come to home.

02:19.000 --> 02:21.000
After that, it didn't have any meaning.

02:21.000 --> 02:23.000
But we have put it so that our navbar looks good.

02:23.000 --> 02:25.000
So, some content will be shown in our navbar.

02:25.000 --> 02:26.000
Ok.

02:26.000 --> 02:28.000
After that, what you have to do is,

02:28.000 --> 02:32.000
First, you have to download the logo from the link.

02:32.000 --> 02:34.000
And after downloading the logo,

02:34.000 --> 02:36.000
you have to go to the source folder from the office.

02:36.000 --> 02:39.000
And here, you have to create a new folder named assets.

02:39.000 --> 02:40.000
Assets.

02:42.000 --> 02:45.000
And in this assets folder, we will put our images.

02:45.000 --> 02:47.000
So, right now, we have one.

02:47.000 --> 02:51.000
The name which I have given is mainlogo.png.

02:51.000 --> 02:53.000
So, this will be the logo.

02:53.000 --> 02:54.000
So, we will use this logo.

02:54.000 --> 02:58.000
So, you have to download it and save it in assets with this name.

02:59.000 --> 03:01.000
After that, you will come to your navbar.

03:01.000 --> 03:03.000
And you will import that logo here.

03:03.000 --> 03:04.000
You will import it.

03:04.000 --> 03:06.000
And you will give it a name on the logo.

03:07.000 --> 03:09.000
You will import it with the name of the logo.

03:09.000 --> 03:11.000
And actually, I have put it.

03:11.000 --> 03:13.000
You will import it by putting the logo.

03:13.000 --> 03:15.000
You will do from.

03:15.000 --> 03:16.000
From where you have to import it.

03:16.000 --> 03:18.000
From.

03:18.000 --> 03:22.000
You are importing it from the folder named assets.

03:22.000 --> 03:23.000
So,

03:23.000 --> 03:24.000
Dot.

03:24.000 --> 03:25.000
Slash.

03:25.000 --> 03:26.000
Assets.

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
In this, you have to do it with your mainlogo.png.

03:29.000 --> 03:32.000
Now, here, you have imported your logo.

03:32.000 --> 03:35.000
Now, you have to go to the source to show it.

03:35.000 --> 03:38.000
And here, you have to just type logo.

03:38.000 --> 03:41.000
So, now, we have put the logo here.

03:41.000 --> 03:43.000
After this, what we have to do is.

03:43.000 --> 03:44.000
We have to give it css.

03:44.000 --> 03:48.000
And after that, we have to import navbar in app.js.

03:48.000 --> 03:50.000
So, for this, we will make css.

03:50.000 --> 03:52.000
So, first, we will go to our css folder.

03:52.000 --> 03:53.000
In the css folder.

03:53.000 --> 03:55.000
In that, we will click and create a new file here.

03:55.000 --> 03:57.000
We will name it navbar.css.

03:59.000 --> 04:00.000
navbar.css.

04:00.000 --> 04:04.000
And you will also get the same css in the code section.

04:04.000 --> 04:07.000
So, you will pick up its css and put it here.

04:07.000 --> 04:10.000
See, basically, this is the meaning of giving you css.

04:10.000 --> 04:14.000
That css is a very basic thing.

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
And you can get this thing anywhere on the web.

04:16.000 --> 04:19.000
But the logic that you use while calling API.

04:19.000 --> 04:20.000
States.

04:20.000 --> 04:21.000
Hooks.

04:21.000 --> 04:23.000
When you are making all these things.

04:23.000 --> 04:24.000
When you are using props.

04:24.000 --> 04:26.000
When you are using object destructuring.

04:26.000 --> 04:31.000
You have to enhance these things by yourself.

04:31.000 --> 04:33.000
You have to understand these things by yourself.

04:33.000 --> 04:38.000
So, this basically enhances your problem solving ability.

04:38.000 --> 04:40.000
You can do styling easily.

04:40.000 --> 04:44.000
So, this is the small style sheet of our navbar.

04:44.000 --> 04:47.000
After this, what we have to do is to import it.

04:47.000 --> 04:50.000
So, to import, you will go here and import.

04:50.000 --> 04:54.000
import navbar.css.

04:54.000 --> 04:59.000
And in this, you will import navbar.css.

04:59.000 --> 05:04.000
So, here you have imported it.

05:04.000 --> 05:08.000
After this, you will have to import the navbar component in the app.

05:08.000 --> 05:09.000
And where in the app?

05:09.000 --> 05:11.000
At the very top.

05:11.000 --> 05:13.000
You will have to import it here at the top.

05:13.000 --> 05:17.000
So, here we have made a div named app.

05:17.000 --> 05:19.000
Basically, we will show everything inside this.

05:19.000 --> 05:23.000
So, we will have to import it inside this.

05:23.000 --> 05:31.000
So, here we will import navbar.css.

05:31.000 --> 05:34.000
And after doing this, a forward slash will come.

05:34.000 --> 05:37.000
And now we have to import it at the top.

05:37.000 --> 05:39.000
But for this, I will tell you a shortcut.

05:39.000 --> 05:41.000
You select navbar like this.

05:41.000 --> 05:44.000
After pressing control, press spacebar.

05:44.000 --> 05:46.000
And it will give you a suggestion.

05:46.000 --> 05:47.000
You have to click on it.

05:47.000 --> 05:48.000
It will be imported automatically.

05:49.000 --> 05:52.000
Here, your navbar has been imported.

05:52.000 --> 05:54.000
Now, what you have to do is,

05:54.000 --> 05:56.000
first of all, you have to check in the terminal

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
whether there is any error or not.

05:58.000 --> 06:00.000
So, there is no error on the terminal.

06:00.000 --> 06:03.000
Now, let's go and check on the browser directly.

06:03.000 --> 06:09.000
So, here you can see that our navbar is showing properly.

06:09.000 --> 06:11.000
And you must have noticed one more thing.

06:11.000 --> 06:13.000
This find fair was very low.

06:13.000 --> 06:14.000
This button was below.

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
After this, it was something different.

06:16.000 --> 06:17.000
Here, the styling was not good.

06:17.000 --> 06:18.000
It means it was not adjusted.

06:18.000 --> 06:21.000
But as soon as you put it, it was adjusted automatically.

06:21.000 --> 06:23.000
So, it is according to the CSS that we did.

06:23.000 --> 06:26.000
So, now you can see that we have the logo here.

06:26.000 --> 06:27.000
It has come.

06:27.000 --> 06:31.000
And after this, your home button has also come.

06:31.000 --> 06:35.000
So, basically, it reloads as soon as we click on it.

06:35.000 --> 06:40.000
Now, after this, the second thing that comes is footer.

06:40.000 --> 06:41.000
So, now what do we do?

06:41.000 --> 06:44.000
We go and put the footer.

06:44.000 --> 06:45.000
So, what do we have to do for this?

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
First of all, you have to go to the components folder.

06:47.000 --> 06:48.000
You have to click on it.

06:48.000 --> 06:50.000
And here you have to make a new file.

06:50.000 --> 06:54.000
By doing footer.jsx.

06:54.000 --> 06:56.000
Now, our footer.

06:56.000 --> 06:58.000
Let me rename it.

06:58.000 --> 06:59.000
I have done something wrong.

06:59.000 --> 07:00.000
Footer.jsx.

07:00.000 --> 07:01.000
Okay.

07:01.000 --> 07:02.000
Now, our footer.

07:02.000 --> 07:05.000
Our footer is very small.

07:05.000 --> 07:10.000
So, you can directly copy the code of the footer from here.

07:10.000 --> 07:12.000
You can paste it from the code section.

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
Because our footer is very small.

07:14.000 --> 07:15.000
There is nothing in it.

07:15.000 --> 07:16.000
And in that, we just.

07:16.000 --> 07:20.000
The same thing that we put in the footer of the movie mania.

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
Date, year, everything is the same.

07:22.000 --> 07:23.000
It is exactly the same.

07:23.000 --> 07:24.000
So, you can see.

07:24.000 --> 07:27.000
And here, the footer of the movie mania is almost the same.

07:27.000 --> 07:30.000
And here, what do you have to do by removing the movie mania?

07:30.000 --> 07:31.000
You have to write flights here.

07:31.000 --> 07:32.000
Flights.

07:32.000 --> 07:33.000
Okay.

07:33.000 --> 07:36.000
So, you have used the same footer.

07:36.000 --> 07:37.000
Just by using its color.

07:37.000 --> 07:38.000
You have used it for this.

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
So, you can reuse the code like this.

07:40.000 --> 07:41.000
It is a very good thing.

07:41.000 --> 07:43.000
So that your work is saved.

07:43.000 --> 07:45.000
You don't have to reinvent the wheel.

07:45.000 --> 07:47.000
So, as soon as you did this.

07:47.000 --> 07:49.000
After that, you check the terminal once again.

07:49.000 --> 07:52.000
And there is no error coming here.

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
Let's see in the browser again.

07:54.000 --> 07:58.000
And in the browser, we have to import the footer in our code first.

07:58.000 --> 07:59.000
So, what do we have to do for that?

07:59.000 --> 08:01.000
We have to come to our code.

08:01.000 --> 08:02.000
We have to go to the bottom.

08:02.000 --> 08:07.000
And just below the main, we have to import the footer.

08:07.000 --> 08:08.000
We will write the footer.

08:08.000 --> 08:09.000
Forward slash.

08:09.000 --> 08:11.000
And here we will select the footer.

08:11.000 --> 08:15.000
And control and space bar.

08:15.000 --> 08:18.000
And here our footer has been imported.

08:18.000 --> 08:21.000
As soon as the footer is imported, you have to check the terminal.

08:21.000 --> 08:23.000
And here there is an error.

08:23.000 --> 08:25.000
Navbar is not defined.

08:25.000 --> 08:26.000
Okay.

08:26.000 --> 08:30.000
So, actually, what happened here was that the import of the navbar was removed by mistake.

08:30.000 --> 08:31.000
You don't have to do anything here.

08:31.000 --> 08:33.000
I will quickly import the navbar.

08:33.000 --> 08:34.000
Yes.

08:34.000 --> 08:35.000
Okay.

08:35.000 --> 08:37.000
So, the footer has also come.

08:37.000 --> 08:40.000
Now, once we will go to our browser.

08:40.000 --> 08:44.000
And after going to the browser, let's check it once.

08:44.000 --> 08:46.000
Let's see whether our footer has come or not.

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
So, our data which we had searched is already there.

08:48.000 --> 08:49.000
We will come to the bottom.

08:49.000 --> 08:51.000
So, see, our footer has come.

08:51.000 --> 08:53.000
Let's reload the site once.

08:53.000 --> 08:57.000
And our footer which is at the bottom has come.

08:57.000 --> 09:02.000
So, from here our project of flights is finally over.

09:02.000 --> 09:08.000
And if you ever have to check the prices and details of flights from now on,

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
then you have your own site.

09:10.000 --> 09:11.000
You can check it.

09:14.000 --> 09:15.000
Thank you so much.

09:15.000 --> 09:15.500
Thank you.
