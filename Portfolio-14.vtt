And I have written skill here.

00:23.000 --> 00:27.000
So, till now, we have made the portfolio only with the id of techy recon.

00:27.000 --> 00:34.000
But now, we are also making the portfolio with the id of this core.standard output.

00:34.000 --> 00:39.000
As soon as we submit here, our information will be saved in sanity.

00:39.000 --> 00:43.000
And as soon as the information is saved, we click on visit your portfolio.

00:43.000 --> 00:48.000
So, we reach the id of core.standard output.

00:48.000 --> 00:49.000
See this.

00:49.000 --> 00:53.000
And as soon as we come here, our everything is visible.

01:07.000 --> 01:10.000
So, here you can see that our email id was this.

01:10.000 --> 01:13.000
The first part of this is core.standard output.

01:13.000 --> 01:16.000
We have used it as an id in the url.

01:16.000 --> 01:17.000
Okay.

01:17.000 --> 01:22.000
So, now if any person will search techy recon, then that person will see the portfolio of techy recon.

01:22.000 --> 01:25.000
And if any person will search core.standard output,

01:25.000 --> 01:27.000
