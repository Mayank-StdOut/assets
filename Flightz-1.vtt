00:06.000 --> 00:10.000
First of all, we have to create a folder named Flights.

00:10.000 --> 00:16.000
So you will create a new folder named Flights.

00:16.000 --> 00:26.000
After that, you have to open the folder and click on the address at the top and write CMD.

00:26.000 --> 00:30.000
Now we will run the command to create an app.

00:30.000 --> 00:32.000
You will remember the command.

00:32.000 --> 00:38.000
npx create react-app

00:38.000 --> 00:41.000
After that, you will enter a dot.

00:41.000 --> 00:47.000
So your own react-app will start creating.

00:47.000 --> 00:50.000
So we wait for our react-app to create.

00:50.000 --> 00:52.000
It takes a little time.

00:56.000 --> 01:03.000
So finally our react-app has been created.

01:03.000 --> 01:08.000
After creating the react-app, you have to use the command npm start.

01:08.000 --> 01:10.000
By which your web development server will start.

01:10.000 --> 01:13.000
And your website will be loaded on the browser.

01:13.000 --> 01:16.000
So we have done npm start here.

01:16.000 --> 01:21.000
And our website has opened in a short time.

01:21.000 --> 01:25.000
So see our react-app has come to our browser.

01:25.000 --> 01:29.000
Now you have to minimize the browser.

01:29.000 --> 01:32.000
And you have to minimize the command prompt too.

01:32.000 --> 01:36.000
After that, you have to press shift plus right click if you are in Windows 11.

01:36.000 --> 01:39.000
And you will get the option of open with code.

01:39.000 --> 01:43.000
You have to click on open with code.

01:43.000 --> 01:47.000
And as soon as you do it, your VS code will open.

01:47.000 --> 01:50.000
Now what you have to do is, I am setting up my VS code here.

01:50.000 --> 01:54.000
So I will put the VS code here on the side.

01:54.000 --> 01:58.000
As soon as the VS code opens, you will see this welcome screen.

01:58.000 --> 01:59.000
You have to remove it.

01:59.000 --> 02:02.000
And first of all, we have to see our file structure here.

02:02.000 --> 02:07.000
So in the file structure, we have a public folder and a source folder.

02:07.000 --> 02:10.000
So first of all, what we will do is, there are some files here that we do not need.

02:10.000 --> 02:12.000
We will remove them.

02:12.000 --> 02:17.000
So first of all, that is our favicon.icon.

02:17.000 --> 02:19.000
So we will remove it.

02:19.000 --> 02:21.000
We do not need it.

02:21.000 --> 02:23.000
So we remove it.

02:24.000 --> 02:26.000
After that, there is this logo.

02:26.000 --> 02:32.000
So we remove these two logos as well.

02:32.000 --> 02:34.000
After that, we come to the source folder.

02:34.000 --> 02:38.000
Here we do not need app.test.js.

02:38.000 --> 02:39.000
We remove it.

02:39.000 --> 02:43.000
After that, we do not need logo.svg here.

02:43.000 --> 02:46.000
Then this report is not of web vitals either.

02:46.000 --> 02:50.000
And this same setup does not need test.js either.

02:50.000 --> 02:52.000
After that, we will go to index.js.

02:52.000 --> 02:54.000
And from here, we have some things.

02:54.000 --> 02:55.000
So we are importing them.

02:55.000 --> 02:57.000
We remove them.

02:57.000 --> 03:01.000
And from below, we remove this whole thing too.

03:01.000 --> 03:06.000
So finally, now our react app is completely clean.

03:06.000 --> 03:08.000
And now we can start development here.
