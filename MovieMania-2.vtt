00:06.000 --> 00:09.000
So now we will create our first react app

00:09.000 --> 00:12.000
So our first project is moviemania

00:12.000 --> 00:14.000
For that we are creating our first react app

00:14.000 --> 00:17.000
So for that you have to create a folder

00:17.000 --> 00:20.000
Whose name we will keep as moviemania

00:20.000 --> 00:22.000
So keep in mind that everything should be in small letters

00:22.000 --> 00:25.000
And after creating the folder moviemania

00:25.000 --> 00:27.000
What you have to do is

00:27.000 --> 00:31.000
If you are in windows 11 then you have to do shift plus right click

00:31.000 --> 00:33.000
And click on open with code

00:33.000 --> 00:38.000
So that your vs code editor will open in that folder

00:38.000 --> 00:40.000
Okay

00:40.000 --> 00:42.000
After that you will be able to see here

00:42.000 --> 00:44.000
In the right top corner

00:44.000 --> 00:46.000
You will see a toggle panel

00:46.000 --> 00:48.000
You have to click on that

00:48.000 --> 00:51.000
And a command prompt will open below

00:51.000 --> 00:54.000
And after that you have to write a command

00:54.000 --> 00:56.000
npx create react app

00:56.000 --> 00:57.000
With this

00:57.000 --> 00:58.000
What will happen is

00:58.000 --> 01:01.000
The basic files and folders that you need in react app

01:01.000 --> 01:03.000
Will be created automatically

01:03.000 --> 01:05.000
You don't have to make it manually

01:05.000 --> 01:06.000
So you will write here

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
npx create react app

01:10.000 --> 01:12.000
And after that you will put a dot

01:12.000 --> 01:13.000
What will happen is

01:13.000 --> 01:15.000
This dot will ensure that

01:15.000 --> 01:16.000
All the files in this folder

01:16.000 --> 01:18.000
Will be created in this folder

01:18.000 --> 01:19.000
All the files that are going to be created

01:19.000 --> 01:20.000
Will be in this folder

01:20.000 --> 01:22.000
So this dot ensures this

01:22.000 --> 01:24.000
After that you will enter it

01:24.000 --> 01:26.000
And this is a time taking process

01:26.000 --> 01:29.000
Because a lot of things are installed in this

01:29.000 --> 01:31.000
So it can take some time

01:31.000 --> 01:33.000
So we will wait for this

01:33.000 --> 01:35.000
So finally after creating react app

01:35.000 --> 01:37.000
You will see something like this below

01:37.000 --> 01:40.000
This will give you a message after success

01:40.000 --> 01:42.000
And our react app is created

01:42.000 --> 01:43.000
Okay

01:43.000 --> 01:45.000
So now we will clear the terminal

01:45.000 --> 01:47.000
With the CLS command

01:47.000 --> 01:49.000
And after that we will make it smaller

01:49.000 --> 01:51.000
So now you can see that

01:51.000 --> 01:54.000
All the files and folders are created automatically

01:54.000 --> 01:55.000
You didn't even make them

01:55.000 --> 01:58.000
When you created this react app

01:58.000 --> 02:00.000
It happened after that

02:00.000 --> 02:02.000
And you can see a lot of things here

02:02.000 --> 02:04.000
That have been created automatically

02:04.000 --> 02:06.000
So now you will put another command here

02:06.000 --> 02:09.000
With which you will be able to run your react app

02:09.000 --> 02:10.000
You will be able to run it

02:10.000 --> 02:11.000
You will be able to see it

02:11.000 --> 02:13.000
So as soon as you run this command

02:13.000 --> 02:14.000
What will happen is

02:14.000 --> 02:17.000
That your react app will run automatically

02:17.000 --> 02:19.000
And you will be able to see it

02:19.000 --> 02:21.000
So as soon as you start npm

02:21.000 --> 02:24.000
The development server runs here

02:24.000 --> 02:27.000
And your react app will open automatically

02:27.000 --> 02:28.000
On the browser

02:28.000 --> 02:29.000
Okay

02:29.000 --> 02:32.000
So this is our first react app

02:32.000 --> 02:33.000
So congratulations

02:33.000 --> 02:35.000
If this is your first react app

02:35.000 --> 02:37.000
Now we will make changes in this

02:37.000 --> 02:39.000
And we will

02:39.000 --> 02:41.000
Make it reach the final project

02:41.000 --> 02:43.000
So after this we will minimize it

02:43.000 --> 02:45.000
And as long as we understand

02:45.000 --> 02:47.000
These folders

02:47.000 --> 02:49.000
And file structures

02:49.000 --> 02:51.000
So basically see here

02:51.000 --> 02:53.000
The main folders of our work

02:53.000 --> 02:55.000
Are these two

02:55.000 --> 02:56.000
Public and source

02:56.000 --> 02:57.000
There are others too

02:57.000 --> 02:59.000
But you will not be able to use the rest

02:59.000 --> 03:01.000
As much as you will be able to use these two folders

03:01.000 --> 03:03.000
Of public and source folder

03:03.000 --> 03:05.000
So the main thing in the public folder

03:05.000 --> 03:07.000
Is index.html

03:07.000 --> 03:08.000
Apart from this all other things

03:08.000 --> 03:09.000
Are of no use

03:09.000 --> 03:11.000
You don't need to pay attention to them

03:11.000 --> 03:13.000
So what is index.html

03:13.000 --> 03:16.000
Here you can see all the content of the website

03:16.000 --> 03:18.000
Here your react app is rendered

03:18.000 --> 03:20.000
That means the website you are able to see

03:20.000 --> 03:21.000
On the browser

03:21.000 --> 03:22.000
Is inside index.html

03:22.000 --> 03:24.000
The whole website

03:24.000 --> 03:26.000
Is inside index.html

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
And you can see it

03:28.000 --> 03:30.000
So when you will do the view page source

03:30.000 --> 03:32.000
Here you will see index.html

03:32.000 --> 03:34.000
After this

03:34.000 --> 03:36.000
The second thing that comes

03:36.000 --> 03:38.000
We have understood index.html

03:38.000 --> 03:40.000
The main thing that comes

03:40.000 --> 03:42.000
Is the source folder

03:42.000 --> 03:44.000
In this you will be writing all your code

03:44.000 --> 03:46.000
And when you have written all the code

03:46.000 --> 03:48.000
The code that you will write here

03:48.000 --> 03:50.000
All this code will go inside this source

03:50.000 --> 03:52.000
And inside this source

03:52.000 --> 03:55.000
There are many components

03:55.000 --> 03:57.000
Here you will put the components inside the source

03:57.000 --> 03:59.000
Now you will understand all that

03:59.000 --> 04:01.000
Before that we will see

04:01.000 --> 04:02.000
Inside the source there is one thing

04:02.000 --> 04:04.000
Index.js file

04:04.000 --> 04:06.000
What index.js file does

04:06.000 --> 04:08.000
That

04:08.000 --> 04:10.000
It renders the application

04:10.000 --> 04:12.000
That means

04:12.000 --> 04:14.000
Whatever code you have written inside your app.js

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
Here whatever you write inside app.js

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
What it does

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
It goes to index.js

04:20.000 --> 04:22.000
And index.js

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000
You send it to the public source

04:24.000 --> 04:26.000
In index.html

04:26.000 --> 04:28.000
So by sending it to public index.html

04:28.000 --> 04:30.000
It renders it

04:30.000 --> 04:32.000
Your website

04:32.000 --> 04:34.000
Then it shows

04:36.000 --> 04:38.000
So here you will be able to see

04:38.000 --> 04:40.000
Inside the source there is app.js

04:40.000 --> 04:42.000
So inside app.js you write your code

04:42.000 --> 04:44.000
The code of the website

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
As it is already written here

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
I will show you

04:48.000 --> 04:49.000
As it is already written here

04:49.000 --> 04:51.000
Everything

04:51.000 --> 04:53.000
And what you see in the browser

04:53.000 --> 04:55.000
So here

04:55.000 --> 04:57.000
For example

04:57.000 --> 04:59.000
Whatever is in this return statement

04:59.000 --> 05:01.000
That is all the code

05:01.000 --> 05:03.000
If I remove it

05:03.000 --> 05:05.000
If I remove all this

05:05.000 --> 05:07.000
And then I save it once

05:07.000 --> 05:09.000
And here I

05:09.000 --> 05:11.000
For now

05:11.000 --> 05:13.000
I put this

05:13.000 --> 05:15.000
Ok

05:15.000 --> 05:17.000
Now I save it

05:17.000 --> 05:19.000
See the whole app is empty

05:19.000 --> 05:21.000
Everything was inside app.js

05:21.000 --> 05:23.000
And as soon as we removed all the code

05:23.000 --> 05:25.000
It is empty

05:25.000 --> 05:27.000
Ok

05:27.000 --> 05:29.000
So whatever you write here

05:29.000 --> 05:31.000
It is written in your website

05:31.000 --> 05:33.000
For now you should know this much

05:33.000 --> 05:35.000
Now

05:35.000 --> 05:37.000
What I have done here

05:37.000 --> 05:39.000
I will slowly explain to you

05:39.000 --> 05:41.000
So first of all

05:41.000 --> 05:43.000
What is this

05:43.000 --> 05:45.000
What is app.js

05:45.000 --> 05:47.000
App.js is basically a component

05:47.000 --> 05:49.000
What is component?

05:49.000 --> 05:51.000
App.js is a component

05:51.000 --> 05:53.000
Of the website of react

05:53.000 --> 05:55.000
Of the website of react

05:55.000 --> 05:57.000
As you can see here

05:57.000 --> 05:59.000
You can see the vs code editor

05:59.000 --> 06:01.000
Let's assume this is a website

06:01.000 --> 06:03.000
So the top part of vs code editor

06:03.000 --> 06:05.000
Where the search is

06:05.000 --> 06:07.000
This is a different component

06:07.000 --> 06:09.000
Which we can call search component

06:09.000 --> 06:11.000
The code you are writing in the middle

06:11.000 --> 06:13.000
This is a different component

06:13.000 --> 06:15.000
Where your folders are visible

06:15.000 --> 06:17.000
This is a different component

06:17.000 --> 06:19.000
In react you can code these parts separately

06:19.000 --> 06:21.000
That is you can code it separately

06:21.000 --> 06:23.000
You can code it separately

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
And you can code it separately

06:25.000 --> 06:27.000
Then you can show these three together

06:27.000 --> 06:29.000
As a website

06:29.000 --> 06:31.000
So app.js is also here

06:31.000 --> 06:33.000
The part you were seeing in app.js

06:33.000 --> 06:35.000
Everything was written in app.js

06:35.000 --> 06:37.000
So now

06:37.000 --> 06:39.000
You will make changes here

06:39.000 --> 06:41.000
And those changes will be seen in your browser

06:41.000 --> 06:43.000
So let's assume

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
For example

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
We make a div here

06:47.000 --> 06:49.000
We make a division tag

06:49.000 --> 06:51.000
So

06:51.000 --> 06:53.000
You must have seen in your html

06:53.000 --> 06:55.000
What is div tag

06:55.000 --> 06:57.000
This div is a basic div tag

06:57.000 --> 06:59.000
In this you write anything

06:59.000 --> 07:01.000
Like hello world

07:01.000 --> 07:03.000
Here we write hello world

07:05.000 --> 07:07.000
You wrote hello world in div

07:07.000 --> 07:09.000
Now you will go to browser

07:09.000 --> 07:11.000
So you will see here

07:11.000 --> 07:13.000
Hello world as it is rendered here

07:13.000 --> 07:15.000
So this is a basic functionality

07:15.000 --> 07:17.000
You will say what is good in this

07:17.000 --> 07:19.000
Now let's assume

07:19.000 --> 07:21.000
You put a bracket here

07:21.000 --> 07:23.000
Curly braces

07:23.000 --> 07:25.000
And in curly braces you write

07:25.000 --> 07:27.000
4 plus 4

07:29.000 --> 07:31.000
If you are making normal websites

07:31.000 --> 07:33.000
If you are using normal html

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
So what happens is

07:35.000 --> 07:37.000
You see 4 plus 4

07:37.000 --> 07:39.000
You only see 4 plus 4

07:39.000 --> 07:41.000
You write hello world bracket 4 plus 4

07:41.000 --> 07:43.000
But when you see here

07:43.000 --> 07:45.000
You will see hello world and 8

07:45.000 --> 07:47.000
This means

07:47.000 --> 07:49.000
You can do logical implementation

07:49.000 --> 07:51.000
In your html

07:51.000 --> 07:53.000
You can add logics in your code

07:53.000 --> 07:55.000
If you were in html

07:55.000 --> 07:57.000
You will see 4 plus 4

07:57.000 --> 07:59.000
But if you are in react

07:59.000 --> 08:01.000
You will see calculated value

08:01.000 --> 08:03.000
Now let's do this

08:03.000 --> 08:05.000
With one more thing

08:05.000 --> 08:07.000
Let's assume

08:07.000 --> 08:09.000
You made a variable

08:09.000 --> 08:11.000
What is a variable

08:11.000 --> 08:13.000
You must have known

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
But then I will tell you

08:15.000 --> 08:17.000
Variables are basically

08:17.000 --> 08:19.000
Used to store any value

08:19.000 --> 08:21.000
Where we make a variable

08:21.000 --> 08:23.000
In javascript

08:23.000 --> 08:25.000
Variable is made in this way

08:25.000 --> 08:27.000
Name of const and variable

08:27.000 --> 08:29.000
Whatever name you give

08:29.000 --> 08:31.000
In question

08:31.000 --> 08:33.000
We give it some value

08:33.000 --> 08:35.000
Like we give react

08:35.000 --> 08:37.000
React here

08:37.000 --> 08:39.000
And what we do after this

08:39.000 --> 08:41.000
In this curly braces

08:41.000 --> 08:43.000
We pass name

08:43.000 --> 08:45.000
And when we save it

08:45.000 --> 08:47.000
You will see

08:47.000 --> 08:49.000
Hello world reacted

08:49.000 --> 08:51.000
You can see

08:51.000 --> 08:53.000
Dynamically values are changing

08:53.000 --> 08:55.000
You can also use variables

08:55.000 --> 08:57.000
In code

08:57.000 --> 08:59.000
So how convenient it is

08:59.000 --> 09:01.000
How useful it is

09:01.000 --> 09:03.000
You must be able to understand

09:03.000 --> 09:05.000
So this was the basics

09:05.000 --> 09:07.000
About our react folders

09:07.000 --> 09:09.000
