WEBVTT

00:06.000 --> 00:11.800
So now we will deploy our site, first of all you have to come to your chrome and here

00:11.800 --> 00:19.880
you have to write app.netlify.com signup, so this is basically a site, its name is netlify,

00:19.880 --> 00:26.560
here you can deploy any of your react application for free, so you signup with github here,

00:26.560 --> 00:28.060
if you have a github account.

00:28.060 --> 00:36.000
If you don't you can quickly go to github.com it's a very easy process, then you have to

00:36.000 --> 00:39.400
go down here and drag and drop the options on the app, we will upload our files from

00:39.400 --> 00:40.400
here.

00:40.400 --> 00:48.640
Now how to do that, we will come to the github vs code, and as we come to the vs code, you

00:48.640 --> 00:54.240
have to create a file by redirecting it to the public folder of your project.

00:54.240 --> 00:55.320
And here we will come to the public folder and here you have to create a file by redirecting

00:55.320 --> 00:56.320
it.

00:56.320 --> 01:03.820
You will create a redirect file, no extension, no .txt, no any name, you will make it with underscore redirects.

01:04.320 --> 01:07.320
In that you will write this thing, a simple line.

01:07.820 --> 01:14.820
This is necessary to define your path and routes in your Netlify when you host the project basically.

01:15.820 --> 01:17.320
Right? So you can understand by name only.

01:17.820 --> 01:23.320
So you just write this thing here, whatever it is, you have to write it as it is.

01:23.820 --> 01:25.820
After that what you have to do is open your command prompt.

01:26.320 --> 01:28.820
If your development server is running, then you can close it.

01:29.320 --> 01:31.820
And here you have to write a command, npm run build.

01:32.320 --> 01:33.820
Npm run build command.

01:34.320 --> 01:35.320
This is the command.

01:35.820 --> 01:39.820
As soon as you enter it, then basically a build folder will be created.

01:40.320 --> 01:42.820
Which you can upload there in Netlify.

01:43.320 --> 01:44.820
So that your site will be deployed.

01:45.320 --> 01:47.820
So this folder will take a few seconds to build.

01:48.320 --> 01:52.820
As soon as the process is completed, you will get a folder by doing a dist.

01:53.320 --> 01:55.820
You will host this dist folder.

01:56.320 --> 01:58.320
You will upload it basically in Netlify.

01:58.820 --> 02:00.320
So you will go back to your Netlify.

02:01.320 --> 02:02.820
So we will go to our Netlify.

02:03.320 --> 02:05.320
And here there is an option to upload browse.

02:05.820 --> 02:06.320
In that you will go.

02:06.820 --> 02:11.320
And here you have to select the dist in your portfolio builder folder and click on upload.

02:12.320 --> 02:13.820
And then you have to click on upload from here.

02:14.320 --> 02:19.820
As soon as you click on upload, the file will be uploaded in a few seconds and your site will be deployed.

02:20.320 --> 02:23.820
Your site has been deployed in just a single click.

02:23.820 --> 02:28.320
As soon as you click on open production deploy, your site will be opened.

02:28.820 --> 02:30.320
But it has got some URL of this type.

02:30.820 --> 02:33.320
So let's do one thing, let's change its domain quickly.

02:33.820 --> 02:36.320
So what we do for this, we go to site configuration.

02:36.820 --> 02:38.320
There will be an option on your left.

02:38.820 --> 02:42.320
After going to site configuration, you have to click on change site name.

02:42.820 --> 02:47.320
And here you have to give a custom name to any custom site.

02:47.820 --> 02:50.320
I have given portfolio builder standard out.

02:50.820 --> 02:52.320
You can give any name.

02:52.320 --> 02:53.820
You have to save this.

02:54.320 --> 02:56.820
As soon as you save, your site has been deployed.

02:57.320 --> 03:00.820
But the process is not complete yet.

03:01.320 --> 03:04.820
As soon as you go to this link, your site has been deployed.

03:05.320 --> 03:10.820
But as soon as you do continuous techie or continuous google for the first time, this will not work.

03:11.320 --> 03:16.820
Because we have to add course origin to our google cloud console and sanity.

03:17.320 --> 03:18.820
So now we will go to google cloud console.

03:19.320 --> 03:20.820
Slash APIs.

03:20.820 --> 03:22.320
Here you have to go to the OAuth token.

03:22.820 --> 03:24.320
You have to click on edit.

03:24.820 --> 03:29.320
As soon as you click on edit, this will open.

03:29.820 --> 03:31.320
URIs, origin, etc.

03:31.820 --> 03:38.320
So first of all, you will do add URI and you will add the name of the app in the way I have added.

03:38.820 --> 03:41.320
In the same way, you have to do the same thing below.

03:41.820 --> 03:47.320
As soon as you add, our google authentication has been set up.

03:47.820 --> 03:49.320
After this, we have to go to sanity.

03:49.320 --> 03:50.820
In sanity.io slash manage.

03:51.320 --> 03:52.820
We have to select the project.

03:53.320 --> 03:54.820
We have to go to the API.

03:55.320 --> 03:58.820
After going to the API, we have to add the course origin here.

03:59.320 --> 04:03.820
And while adding, you have to remember to click on the allow credentials button.

04:04.320 --> 04:04.820
Okay.

04:05.320 --> 04:06.320
And all of this is done for us.

04:06.820 --> 04:08.320
Now finally, this work will be done.

04:08.820 --> 04:12.820
And your site has been finally uploaded and deployed.

04:13.320 --> 04:15.820
You can share it with anyone from here.

04:16.320 --> 04:17.820
To any of your friends.

04:17.820 --> 04:20.320
Or you can list it in any of your resumes.

04:20.820 --> 04:23.320
Because now you have a deployed URL.

04:23.820 --> 04:24.320
Okay.

04:24.820 --> 04:25.820
Now after this.

04:26.320 --> 04:28.320
Now what can we do extra in this?

04:28.820 --> 04:30.320
This is what you have to see.

04:30.820 --> 04:32.820
So now what we have done here basically till now.

04:33.320 --> 04:34.820
That we had taken a portfolio form.

04:35.320 --> 04:35.820
Isn't it?

04:36.320 --> 04:39.820
And we were using the same portfolio form to fill the details.

04:40.320 --> 04:45.320
And according to the user who was entering the details, the portfolio website was being created.

04:45.320 --> 04:49.820
But now I would like you to give the option of templates in this.

04:50.320 --> 04:52.820
As soon as the user logs in, there will be a lot of templates.

04:53.320 --> 04:55.820
User select a template from those templates.

04:56.320 --> 04:57.820
Enter your data, save it.

04:58.320 --> 05:00.820
And its site will be ready according to that same template.

05:01.320 --> 05:02.820
This is not at all difficult.

05:03.320 --> 05:04.820
If you try, it will definitely happen.

05:05.320 --> 05:08.820
And here, the user will get a lot of variety options.

05:09.320 --> 05:12.820
And by doing a lot of things in this, it is possible that you can make it better tomorrow.

05:13.320 --> 05:14.820
And a very good project will be made.

05:15.320 --> 05:19.820
So for now, our portfolio builder project is finally over.
