00:06.000 --> 00:12.000
So now the first thing we have to do while creating an extension is that we have to create a scraping function.

00:12.000 --> 00:15.000
What is scraping? First of all, let's understand this.

00:15.000 --> 00:24.000
Scraping means that you are extracting text content or any type of things from your web page.

00:24.000 --> 00:31.000
For example, tomorrow you have to know the current price of the laptops.

00:31.000 --> 00:35.000
And you don't have any such source, you don't have any API.

00:35.000 --> 00:42.000
So what will you do? You will go to any such website which sells laptops.

00:42.000 --> 00:47.000
And there you will go from there and check the prices.

00:47.000 --> 00:52.000
So this is a normal way. But if you are a developer, then what will you do?

00:52.000 --> 00:54.000
At that time you will write a code.

00:54.000 --> 00:58.000
You will write a function which will go to the website on your behalf.

00:58.000 --> 01:01.000
It will scrape all the prices from there.

01:01.000 --> 01:04.000
That is, it will extract from there and then it will show you.

01:04.000 --> 01:06.000
So this is scraping.

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
And there are many things of scraping.

01:08.000 --> 01:10.000
There are many functionalities.

01:10.000 --> 01:14.000
You can make many useful things from scraping.

01:14.000 --> 01:18.000
So the main thing here is to scrape.

01:18.000 --> 01:21.000
So what will you do for that? First of all, you will open your server.

01:21.000 --> 01:23.000
By doing npm run dev.

01:23.000 --> 01:24.000
Start the server.

01:24.000 --> 01:26.000
And after that what I have done.

01:26.000 --> 01:28.000
You have to go to the source folder.

01:28.000 --> 01:30.000
In it, you have to go to the popup.

01:30.000 --> 01:34.000
And after going to the popup, you have to open popup.psx.

01:34.000 --> 01:38.000
And here we will start writing our scraping function.

01:38.000 --> 01:40.000
Now what will we do with that?

01:40.000 --> 01:42.000
First of all, there are curly braces in the popup.

01:42.000 --> 01:43.000
So you remove them.

01:43.000 --> 01:46.000
And after that, first of all, we make a function.

01:46.000 --> 01:50.000
Whose name we will name by scraping page content.

01:50.000 --> 01:53.000
Scraping page content.

01:53.000 --> 01:56.000
And this will be an arrow function.

01:56.000 --> 02:02.000
So now in this, the first thing we will put.

02:02.000 --> 02:06.000
That while scraping, you don't need anything.

02:06.000 --> 02:08.000
For example, we don't need script tags.

02:08.000 --> 02:10.000
We don't know what is written in it.

02:10.000 --> 02:11.000
We don't want sorry.

02:11.000 --> 02:15.000
And what is written in style tags, we don't care about that.

02:15.000 --> 02:19.000
So scraping works only in HTML elements.

02:19.000 --> 02:22.000
Your frontend of your code.

02:22.000 --> 02:24.000
In which HTML is written.

02:24.000 --> 02:26.000
When you do view page source.

02:26.000 --> 02:33.000
So scraping works for you to extract content from the same HTML elements.

02:33.000 --> 02:36.000
So first we will exclude some things.

02:36.000 --> 02:38.000
We will put it in excluded tags.

02:38.000 --> 02:44.000
In it, we will mention such tags which we don't want to scrape.

02:44.000 --> 02:48.000
For example, for now we don't want to scrape the script tag.

02:48.000 --> 02:51.000
After that, we don't want content in the style tag.

02:51.000 --> 02:53.000
We don't want it.

02:53.000 --> 02:56.000
Now after this, we will create a walker.

02:56.000 --> 02:59.000
Which will travel on the whole HTML elements.

02:59.000 --> 03:01.000
Will pick up everyone one by one.

03:01.000 --> 03:05.000
And the first thing it will do is.

03:05.000 --> 03:07.000
I will tell you.

03:07.000 --> 03:14.000
It will traverse all these elements.

03:14.000 --> 03:17.000
That is, I will tell you this once nicely.

03:17.000 --> 03:20.000
So this document.body.

03:21.000 --> 03:22.000
And after this.

03:22.000 --> 03:32.000
NoteFilter.showText.

03:32.000 --> 03:33.000
Now what happened here.

03:33.000 --> 03:35.000
Let's see this once.

03:35.000 --> 03:39.000
So basically, this tree walker.

03:39.000 --> 03:40.000
Which we have made.

03:40.000 --> 03:42.000
Document.createTWalker.

03:42.000 --> 03:44.000
What does it do?

03:44.000 --> 03:49.000
Its work is that whatever your HTML elements are.

03:49.000 --> 03:50.000
Which are your HTML elements.

03:50.000 --> 03:54.000
It will go on them one by one.

03:54.000 --> 04:01.000
And it will pick up all the text content elements inside them.

04:01.000 --> 04:03.000
That is.

04:03.000 --> 04:05.000
What we have done here is.

04:05.000 --> 04:07.000
It has said that document.body.

04:07.000 --> 04:09.000
That is, the top element.

04:09.000 --> 04:10.000
Body element.

04:10.000 --> 04:12.000
From there you go to the end.

04:12.000 --> 04:14.000
Start with the body element.

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
And till the end you go one by one.

04:16.000 --> 04:17.000
On all the elements.

04:17.000 --> 04:19.000
And inside them too.

04:19.000 --> 04:20.000
To go to the text elements.

04:20.000 --> 04:21.000
Only go to them.

04:21.000 --> 04:22.000
That is.

04:22.000 --> 04:23.000
For example, at the top.

04:23.000 --> 04:24.000
The body element.

04:24.000 --> 04:25.000
Inside it.

04:25.000 --> 04:26.000
There can be any image tag.

04:26.000 --> 04:27.000
Inside it.

04:27.000 --> 04:28.000
There can be any div tag.

04:28.000 --> 04:29.000
Inside it.

04:29.000 --> 04:30.000
There can be any iframe.

04:30.000 --> 04:31.000
So here there can be many elements.

04:31.000 --> 04:32.000
But we told it.

04:32.000 --> 04:33.000
That you start with body tag.

04:33.000 --> 04:34.000
Walk.

04:34.000 --> 04:35.000
Right.

04:35.000 --> 04:36.000
Start filtering out from body tag.

04:36.000 --> 04:37.000
And go till the end.

04:37.000 --> 04:38.000
And only pick up text elements.

04:38.000 --> 04:39.000
Inside which text.

04:39.000 --> 04:40.000
Like inside any span tag.

04:40.000 --> 04:41.000
Inside any heading tag.

04:41.000 --> 04:42.000
And then.

04:42.000 --> 04:43.000
You can go.

04:43.000 --> 04:44.000
You can go.

04:44.000 --> 04:45.000
You can go.

04:45.000 --> 04:46.000
You can go.

04:46.000 --> 04:47.000
You can go.

04:47.000 --> 04:48.000
You can go.

04:48.000 --> 04:49.000
Inside any span tag.

04:49.000 --> 04:50.000
Inside any heading tag.

04:50.000 --> 04:51.000
Inside any paragraph tag.

04:51.000 --> 04:52.000
So.

04:52.000 --> 04:53.000
Go to such a place.

04:53.000 --> 04:54.000
Where there are text elements.

04:54.000 --> 04:55.000
Hope.

04:55.000 --> 04:56.000
You must have understood so much.

04:56.000 --> 04:57.000
Now we are moving ahead.

04:57.000 --> 04:58.000
So you will understand better.

04:58.000 --> 04:59.000
After this.

04:59.000 --> 05:00.000
We will make a variable by doing a page content.

05:00.000 --> 05:01.000
And in it.

05:01.000 --> 05:02.000
Whatever is our page content.

05:02.000 --> 05:03.000
We will append it.

05:03.000 --> 05:04.000
That is.

05:04.000 --> 05:05.000
We will put it in it.

05:05.000 --> 05:06.000
Inside the page content.

05:06.000 --> 05:07.000
Whatever we will get.

05:07.000 --> 05:08.000
Text.

05:08.000 --> 05:09.000
We will keep putting it in it.

05:09.000 --> 05:10.000
Then.

05:10.000 --> 05:11.000
We will make one more variable.

05:11.000 --> 05:12.000
That is.

05:12.000 --> 05:13.000
That is.

05:13.000 --> 05:14.000
That is.

05:14.000 --> 05:15.000
That is.

05:15.000 --> 05:16.000
That is.

05:16.000 --> 05:17.000
That is.

05:17.000 --> 05:18.000
That is.

05:18.000 --> 05:19.000
That is.

05:19.000 --> 05:20.000
Whatever is in it.

05:20.000 --> 05:21.000
Whatever is in it.

05:21.000 --> 05:22.000
Which we will keep in name.

05:22.000 --> 05:23.000
CurrentNode.

05:23.000 --> 05:24.000
What will we do on this.

05:24.000 --> 05:25.000
We are not assigning any value to it.

05:25.000 --> 05:26.000
Inside current node.

05:26.000 --> 05:27.000
We.

05:27.000 --> 05:29.000
In whichever node we are.

05:29.000 --> 05:30.000
That is.

05:30.000 --> 05:31.000
What will be the node?

05:31.000 --> 05:32.000
Basically.

05:32.000 --> 05:33.000
Elements.

05:33.000 --> 05:34.000
Suppose.

05:34.000 --> 05:35.000
We go to any.

05:35.000 --> 05:36.000
Body element.

05:36.000 --> 05:37.000
Then below that.

05:37.000 --> 05:38.000
There is head.

05:38.000 --> 05:39.000
Then below that.

05:39.000 --> 05:40.000
There is a span.

05:40.000 --> 05:41.000
Then below that.

05:41.000 --> 05:42.000
There is a div.

05:42.000 --> 05:43.000
So.

05:43.000 --> 05:44.000
Whatever element we are inside.

05:44.000 --> 05:45.000
That.

05:45.000 --> 05:46.000
Will be stored inside currentNode.

05:46.000 --> 05:47.000
For example.

05:47.000 --> 05:48.000
Now.

05:48.000 --> 05:53.000
If we are in div tag, then it will show div tag.

05:53.000 --> 05:56.000
Now after this, we will put a loop.

05:56.000 --> 05:59.000
And this will be a while loop.

05:59.000 --> 06:01.000
What will be the while loop?

06:01.000 --> 06:05.000
It will check the current node.

06:05.000 --> 06:11.000
And here I will tell you nicely, I will write first what is this.

06:11.000 --> 06:18.000
So what is the work of the while loop here?

06:18.000 --> 06:26.000
So basically, this current node will work to put the next node in it.

06:26.000 --> 06:31.000
That is, whatever it will travel, this walker will move forward,

06:31.000 --> 06:33.000
then that node will change.

06:33.000 --> 06:35.000
First it will be the div node, div tag.

06:35.000 --> 06:37.000
You understand the node from the element here.

06:37.000 --> 06:38.000
Div element will be there.

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
Then there will be a paragraph element.

06:40.000 --> 06:41.000
So it is working here.

06:41.000 --> 06:45.000
It will keep setting the next node in the current node.

06:45.000 --> 06:48.000
That is, first div tag happened, so it will set div tag.

06:48.000 --> 06:51.000
As it moved forward, then paragraph tag came,

06:51.000 --> 06:53.000
then it will set paragraph tag in it.

06:53.000 --> 06:55.000
So it is doing this work in it.

06:55.000 --> 06:58.000
Now in it, we will check some conditions first.

06:58.000 --> 07:02.000
If, first condition we will check here.

07:02.000 --> 07:06.000
That if tag is excluded,

07:06.000 --> 07:09.000
if tag is not excluded,

07:09.000 --> 07:10.000
then what will we want?

07:10.000 --> 07:14.000
If tag is not excluded, that is, if there is no script tag,

07:14.000 --> 07:15.000
if there is no style tag,

07:15.000 --> 07:17.000
then we will want it to be scraped.

07:17.000 --> 07:19.000
And the text content in it,

07:19.000 --> 07:21.000
put it in the page content.

07:21.000 --> 07:24.000
Sorry, put it in the page content.

07:24.000 --> 07:27.000
Now understand it like this.

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
That we went into some tag.

07:29.000 --> 07:30.000
It can be any tag.

07:30.000 --> 07:35.000
There is a div tag, which is a div tag, for example.

07:35.000 --> 07:38.000
Now there will be no style or script tag in the div tag.

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
So what will we do now?

07:40.000 --> 07:43.000
Now we have seen that there is no tag in it,

07:43.000 --> 07:45.000
which is excluded.

07:45.000 --> 07:48.000
So the text content will be scraped from it.

07:48.000 --> 07:51.000
And it will be appended in the page content.

07:51.000 --> 07:52.000
That is, it will be put.

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
So we are checking here first.

07:54.000 --> 07:58.000
That if there is no excluded tag,

07:58.000 --> 08:03.000
and we will name that excluded tag by tag.

08:03.000 --> 08:06.000
If the tag is not excluded, then we will name it by tag.

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
And we will say, call an arrow function.

08:08.000 --> 08:14.000
And before that, we will close it like this.

08:14.000 --> 08:16.000
This is a function.

08:16.000 --> 08:20.000
So in it, we will use an arrow method.

08:20.000 --> 08:25.000
We will say here that if the current node,

08:25.000 --> 08:27.000
which is the parent node,

08:27.000 --> 08:29.000
that is, now I will do one thing.

08:29.000 --> 08:32.000
I will write this code in front of you once.

08:32.000 --> 08:34.000
And then I will explain it to you.

08:34.000 --> 08:37.000
So that you can understand it well.

08:37.000 --> 08:42.000
So for this, I want to do this first.

08:42.000 --> 08:45.000
OK.

08:45.000 --> 08:47.000
OK.

08:47.000 --> 08:50.000
So here there is a problem with some tags.

08:50.000 --> 08:51.000
This is fine.

08:51.000 --> 08:52.000
Here it is fine.

08:52.000 --> 08:55.000
It is attached here in the while loop.

08:55.000 --> 08:56.000
This is fine.

08:56.000 --> 08:58.000
This is fine.

08:58.000 --> 09:00.000
OK.

09:00.000 --> 09:01.000
OK.

09:01.000 --> 09:05.000
And here it is saying that it is not getting excluded tags.

09:05.000 --> 09:06.000
Excluded tags.

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
Did we do something wrong with the spelling of excluded tags?

09:08.000 --> 09:09.000
Yes.

09:09.000 --> 09:12.000
So here we made the spelling of excluded tags wrong.

09:12.000 --> 09:13.000
OK.

09:13.000 --> 09:14.000
So what is happening now?

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
Let's understand it well once.

09:16.000 --> 09:20.000
We said that if the tag is not excluded,

09:20.000 --> 09:23.000
then we will name it by tag.

09:23.000 --> 09:25.000
That the tag is not excluded.

09:25.000 --> 09:27.000
So we will name it by tag.

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
And now in the current node,

09:29.000 --> 09:32.000
current node, for example, is in a paragraph tag.

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
So that paragraph tag is inside div tag.

09:34.000 --> 09:37.000
There is a paragraph tag which comes inside a div tag.

09:37.000 --> 09:39.000
So we will say that it is its parent node.

09:39.000 --> 09:44.000
So if the parent node of current node exists,

09:44.000 --> 09:48.000
then we will take its tag name and we will do it in lower case.

09:48.000 --> 09:52.000
For example, current tag is paragraph tag.

09:52.000 --> 09:55.000
And its parent node is div tag.

09:55.000 --> 10:00.000
So we will do the name of div tag in lower case.

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
And we will store it instead of tag.

10:02.000 --> 10:09.000
And we will compare it with tag.

10:09.000 --> 10:11.000
And then what we will do is,

10:11.000 --> 10:14.000
whatever will be our page content here,

10:14.000 --> 10:18.000
whatever content will be there,

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
text content will be there.

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
See, we wrote that whatever text content of current node will be there,

10:22.000 --> 10:26.000
we will put it directly in page content.

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
So basically we have done nothing here.

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
Let me explain you in the easiest way.

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
That we saw that tag is excluded.

10:32.000 --> 10:35.000
If it is not there, then we took its text content

10:35.000 --> 10:39.000
and then cleared all the spaces from it.

10:39.000 --> 10:42.000
And we put it in page content.

10:42.000 --> 10:45.000
You must have understood this much.

10:45.000 --> 10:47.000
So we did the same thing.

10:47.000 --> 10:50.000
After this, all this is done.

10:50.000 --> 10:55.000
And if tag is excluded, then we are not doing anything for it.

10:55.000 --> 10:57.000
Now we come out of our while loop.

10:57.000 --> 10:59.000
We come out of our while loop.

10:59.000 --> 11:01.000
And here the first thing we will do is,

11:01.000 --> 11:06.000
that now the page content,

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
means this,

11:08.000 --> 11:11.000
some things should not remain in it.

11:11.000 --> 11:16.000
That means some angular brackets should not remain.

11:16.000 --> 11:19.000
Some things are there which are sometimes left.

11:19.000 --> 11:23.000
So we want to remove those things from our page content.

11:23.000 --> 11:26.000
For example, if someone has put any comment in div tag,

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
in paragraph tag,

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
then no one does that.

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
But if someone has done that,

11:32.000 --> 11:33.000
then they should be removed.

11:33.000 --> 11:34.000
They should be replaced.

11:34.000 --> 11:35.000
If there are any white spaces,

11:35.000 --> 11:36.000
then they should be removed.

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
So for that what we will do is,

11:38.000 --> 11:40.000
that we will clean it first.

11:40.000 --> 11:43.000
Whatever content has come to us,

11:43.000 --> 11:44.000
we will clean it first.

11:44.000 --> 11:47.000
So what will we do with clean text?

11:47.000 --> 11:50.000
That we will take page content first.

11:50.000 --> 11:54.000
And then after this, we will use a regex here.

11:54.000 --> 11:57.000
That is, we will use regular expressions here.

11:57.000 --> 11:58.000
Let me tell you,

11:58.000 --> 12:01.000
that here we will use something like this.

12:01.000 --> 12:04.000
All the things with angular brackets from the page content,

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
if anything is in angular brackets,

12:06.000 --> 12:07.000
then it will remove it.

12:07.000 --> 12:12.000
And it will just remove it normally.

12:12.000 --> 12:13.000
So what will happen here?

12:13.000 --> 12:15.000
For example, if I take it here,

12:15.000 --> 12:18.000
that anything is written here.

12:18.000 --> 12:20.000
Like it is written here,

12:20.000 --> 12:22.000
hello world,

12:22.000 --> 12:23.000
this is,

12:23.000 --> 12:25.000
react.

12:25.000 --> 12:27.000
By doing this, anything is written.

12:27.000 --> 12:29.000
If it is written in angular brackets,

12:29.000 --> 12:31.000
then you will not want that along with our page content,

12:31.000 --> 12:32.000
we just need text.

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
We do not need angular brackets.

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
So we will remove all these things

12:36.000 --> 12:39.000
if it will exist then.

12:39.000 --> 12:41.000
Otherwise we will keep it as it is.

12:41.000 --> 12:43.000
And the second thing will be,

12:43.000 --> 12:45.000
that will be,

12:45.000 --> 12:47.000
trimmed text.

12:47.000 --> 12:48.000
That is,

12:48.000 --> 12:51.000
whatever white spaces it will have in the text,

12:51.000 --> 12:52.000
in the code,

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
we will want to remove that.

12:54.000 --> 12:57.000
That is, in the sense of our page content in the code,

12:57.000 --> 12:59.000
whatever white spaces it will have in it,

12:59.000 --> 13:01.000
we will want to remove all of them.

13:01.000 --> 13:03.000
So we will remove something like this.

13:03.000 --> 13:04.000
So first of all,

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
we cleaned the text,

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
that is, all the useless angular brackets,

13:08.000 --> 13:09.000
we removed all of them.

13:09.000 --> 13:10.000
After this,

13:10.000 --> 13:12.000
we cleaned it.

13:12.000 --> 13:14.000
That is, all the spaces,

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
what did we remove first?

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
Okay.

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
This thing is done.

13:20.000 --> 13:22.000
So now after this,

13:22.000 --> 13:23.000
the second thing that comes,

13:23.000 --> 13:26.000
we made the scrape page content.

13:26.000 --> 13:27.000
But,

13:27.000 --> 13:29.000
when we will go to scrape it now,

13:29.000 --> 13:30.000
when we will call it,

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
then it will not scrape.

13:32.000 --> 13:34.000
Now why is this?

13:34.000 --> 13:36.000
So the first thing is,

13:36.000 --> 13:38.000
that our extension,

13:38.000 --> 13:39.000
let me show you,

13:39.000 --> 13:41.000
our extension,

13:41.000 --> 13:43.000
when it will go to scrape,

13:43.000 --> 13:45.000
then it will scrape the content inside itself.

13:45.000 --> 13:47.000
That is, I want to show you,

13:47.000 --> 13:49.000
I open my browser.

13:49.000 --> 13:51.000
And after opening the browser,

13:51.000 --> 13:53.000
I go where my extension is.

13:53.000 --> 13:56.000
And here,

13:56.000 --> 13:57.000
I show you,

13:57.000 --> 13:59.000
this is our extension.

13:59.000 --> 14:02.000
This is our extension.

14:02.000 --> 14:03.000
Now what is happening here?

14:03.000 --> 14:04.000
First let's see this.

14:04.000 --> 14:05.000
Now here,

14:05.000 --> 14:06.000
for example,

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
I have run the function of scrape content.

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
So what will it do?

14:10.000 --> 14:13.000
That it will consider this extension as its web page.

14:13.000 --> 14:16.000
Because we have not specified anything there.

14:16.000 --> 14:19.000
So as soon as the scrape function will run,

14:19.000 --> 14:21.000
then it will give you

14:21.000 --> 14:25.000
by extracting the things inside this extension.

14:25.000 --> 14:28.000
Let me show you by doing this thing.

14:28.000 --> 14:30.000
So here,

14:30.000 --> 14:32.000
as soon as

14:32.000 --> 14:34.000
I go to

14:34.000 --> 14:37.000
my code,

14:37.000 --> 14:39.000
and here I put a function of onclick

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
inside this div.

14:41.000 --> 14:43.000
As soon as it is onclicked,

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
so here,

14:45.000 --> 14:46.000
first of all,

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
we do console.log.

14:48.000 --> 14:51.000
dot log

14:51.000 --> 14:53.000
trim text whatever it is,

14:53.000 --> 14:54.000
we show it here.

14:54.000 --> 14:57.000
Whenever someone clicks in hello world,

14:57.000 --> 14:59.000
then we will call this function.

14:59.000 --> 15:01.000
We will call the function of scrape page content.

15:01.000 --> 15:03.000
Now let's check it once.

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
We came to our browser.

15:05.000 --> 15:07.000
This is our extension.

15:07.000 --> 15:09.000
Whatever we have in hello world,

15:09.000 --> 15:11.000
we have clicked.

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
Let's go to inspect.

15:13.000 --> 15:15.000
Let's go to console.

15:15.000 --> 15:17.000
And let's click it once.

15:17.000 --> 15:19.000
Why is it not working now?

15:19.000 --> 15:20.000
Let's check it once.

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
Let's go to the console.

15:22.000 --> 15:23.000
Let's go to the console.

15:23.000 --> 15:27.000
Let's check it once.

15:27.000 --> 15:28.000
For this,

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
I go to my terminal once.

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
Is there any problem here?

15:32.000 --> 15:34.000
GSX attribute must only be assigned

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
a non-empty expression.

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
So there was some problem up there,

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
but it has been fixed.

15:40.000 --> 15:42.000
And now it has been successfully run.

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
But before that,

15:44.000 --> 15:50.000
let's check our code once again.

15:50.000 --> 15:52.000
Here we have logged.

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
So let's show it directly on alert.

15:54.000 --> 15:56.000
Let's do one thing.

15:56.000 --> 15:59.000
We will show an alert of trim text.

15:59.000 --> 16:01.000
And in the onclick method,

16:01.000 --> 16:03.000
the scrape page content will run.

16:03.000 --> 16:05.000
And in the onclick method,

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
the scrape page content will run.

16:07.000 --> 16:09.000
And let's check the terminal once again.

16:09.000 --> 16:11.000
Everything is running successfully now.

16:11.000 --> 16:13.000
Let's go back to the browser.

16:13.000 --> 16:15.000
Let's go back to the browser.

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
Let's go back to the browser.

16:17.000 --> 16:19.000
And after this,

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
let's see it once by clicking.

16:21.000 --> 16:22.000
As soon as I clicked,

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
the content of hello world came.

16:24.000 --> 16:26.000
But what did we want?

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
That we don't get the content of our extension.

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
We want the content of our web page.

16:30.000 --> 16:31.000
This is written by Google,

16:31.000 --> 16:32.000
this is written by YouTube.

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
All these things are written behind.

16:34.000 --> 16:35.000
We want this.

16:35.000 --> 16:37.000
What will we do with this content?

16:37.000 --> 16:39.000
So now what we have to do is

16:39.000 --> 16:40.000
first of all,

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
we have to extract the content of the web page.

16:42.000 --> 16:43.000
Till now,

16:43.000 --> 16:45.000
the content of the extension was being extracted.

16:45.000 --> 16:46.000
So for that,

16:46.000 --> 16:49.000
we will use the tab and scripting API of Chrome.

16:49.000 --> 16:50.000
Basically,

16:50.000 --> 16:51.000
these are the functions,

16:51.000 --> 16:52.000
these are the methods.

16:52.000 --> 16:53.000
So for that,

16:53.000 --> 16:54.000
what we do is

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
we make another function by summarizing

16:56.000 --> 16:58.000
the content of our script page.

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
And this function,

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
this function has been given to you

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
in your code section.

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
So you copy this function from the code section.

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
And I have pasted it here.

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
Now I will explain it to you nicely once.

17:10.000 --> 17:11.000
What is this?

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
We have put in this summarized function,

17:13.000 --> 17:15.000
chrome.tabs.query.

17:15.000 --> 17:16.000
What does this do?

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
It detects the current window.

17:18.000 --> 17:19.000
Current tabs.

17:19.000 --> 17:23.000
It detects the current tab in which you are currently in.

17:23.000 --> 17:27.000
And then this chrome.scripting.executescript method

17:27.000 --> 17:32.000
runs this scripting function in that same tab.

17:32.000 --> 17:35.000
So when you call this summarized function,

17:35.000 --> 17:37.000
then in whichever current tab you are in,

17:37.000 --> 17:38.000
in that tab,

17:38.000 --> 17:39.000
the script,

17:39.000 --> 17:42.000
the page content function will be called.

17:42.000 --> 17:43.000
So now,

17:43.000 --> 17:44.000
for example,

17:44.000 --> 17:45.000
if we go to any web page,

17:45.000 --> 17:48.000
if we go to any Wikipedia page,

17:48.000 --> 17:51.000
and when we call this summarized function,

17:51.000 --> 17:52.000
for example,

17:52.000 --> 17:53.000
right now,

17:53.000 --> 17:54.000
in our text,

17:54.000 --> 17:55.000
hello world,

17:55.000 --> 17:57.000
we were calling the script page content function.

17:57.000 --> 18:00.000
Now we call the summarized function once.

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
And whenever you call the summarized function,

18:02.000 --> 18:03.000
that is,

18:03.000 --> 18:04.000
when you click on hello world,

18:04.000 --> 18:05.000
then,

18:05.000 --> 18:07.000
what was happening earlier was that

18:07.000 --> 18:09.000
the content of the extension was being fetched.

18:09.000 --> 18:10.000
But now,

18:10.000 --> 18:13.000
the content of the web page will be fetched here.

18:13.000 --> 18:14.000
So here,

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
we have just declared here that

18:16.000 --> 18:17.000
it detects the current tab.

18:17.000 --> 18:18.000
And after that,

18:18.000 --> 18:23.000
this function executes any function in that tab.

18:23.000 --> 18:24.000
So now,

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
once we go to our web page,

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
and once in the web page,

18:28.000 --> 18:31.000
now we open any page.

18:31.000 --> 18:32.000
For example,

18:32.000 --> 18:35.000
we open some Wikipedia page,

18:35.000 --> 18:38.000
in which we do AI Wikipedia.

18:38.000 --> 18:41.000
And here I open it.

18:41.000 --> 18:44.000
And now I open the extension.

18:44.000 --> 18:45.000
And here,

18:45.000 --> 18:46.000
as soon as we click on hello world,

18:46.000 --> 18:49.000
then,

18:49.000 --> 18:51.000
as soon as we click on hello world,

18:51.000 --> 18:52.000
then for this,

18:52.000 --> 18:53.000
there is one thing,

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
we forgot to set up one thing,

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
which is to lock it in the console.

18:57.000 --> 19:01.000
So once we go back.

19:01.000 --> 19:02.000
And here,

19:02.000 --> 19:03.000
now let's go up,

19:03.000 --> 19:04.000
a little script page content,

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
which is our function.

19:06.000 --> 19:07.000
Let's see it.

19:07.000 --> 19:10.000
And here,

19:10.000 --> 19:11.000
the alert,

19:11.000 --> 19:13.000
we had kept this alert.

19:13.000 --> 19:14.000
We remove this alert.

19:14.000 --> 19:15.000
Let's do one thing,

19:15.000 --> 19:17.000
that we make a state before this.

19:17.000 --> 19:18.000
And in that state,

19:18.000 --> 19:19.000
we will set the data.

19:19.000 --> 19:21.000
And in that,

19:21.000 --> 19:22.000
what will we do?

19:22.000 --> 19:23.000
That we will set the summary,

19:23.000 --> 19:25.000
or we will set the data.

19:25.000 --> 19:26.000
For now,

19:26.000 --> 19:27.000
for now,

19:27.000 --> 19:29.000
for now.

19:29.000 --> 19:30.000
So what do we do for this?

19:30.000 --> 19:31.000
That,

19:31.000 --> 19:33.000
const,

19:33.000 --> 19:34.000
and we write the name of the state,

19:34.000 --> 19:35.000
we,

19:35.000 --> 19:37.000
extracted data,

19:37.000 --> 19:39.000
extracted,

19:39.000 --> 19:41.000
extracted,

19:41.000 --> 19:44.000
and set extracted.

19:45.000 --> 19:47.000
Extracted,

19:47.000 --> 19:49.000
by doing,

19:49.000 --> 19:51.000
use state.

19:51.000 --> 19:52.000
And for now,

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
we do something like this.

19:54.000 --> 19:55.000
Now,

19:55.000 --> 19:56.000
let's do one thing,

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
that we,

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
set,

20:00.000 --> 20:01.000
extracted,

20:01.000 --> 20:05.000
OK.

20:05.000 --> 20:06.000
And in it,

20:06.000 --> 20:07.000
we set,

20:07.000 --> 20:09.000
the framed text.

20:09.000 --> 20:10.000
After this,

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
we will lock it in the console.

20:12.000 --> 20:13.000
By the way,

20:13.000 --> 20:14.000
we did not need to set it,

20:14.000 --> 20:15.000
because in the future,

20:15.000 --> 20:17.000
we will directly send this data to the API.

20:17.000 --> 20:18.000
But for now,

20:18.000 --> 20:19.000
we have done it.

20:19.000 --> 20:20.000
So,

20:20.000 --> 20:21.000
OK.

20:21.000 --> 20:23.000
Extracted.

20:23.000 --> 20:24.000
And,

20:24.000 --> 20:25.000
now,

20:25.000 --> 20:26.000
what will we do?

20:26.000 --> 20:27.000
Now,

20:27.000 --> 20:31.000
we will go to our web page once.

20:31.000 --> 20:32.000
So,

20:32.000 --> 20:33.000
we have come back to our web page.

20:33.000 --> 20:34.000
Once,

20:34.000 --> 20:35.000
we go back,

20:35.000 --> 20:37.000
and click on Hello World.

20:37.000 --> 20:39.000
As soon as we clicked on Hello World,

20:39.000 --> 20:40.000
so,

20:40.000 --> 20:41.000
now you have to notice one thing,

20:41.000 --> 20:42.000
that it must have been logged in the console.

20:42.000 --> 20:43.000
When you inspect,

20:43.000 --> 20:44.000
console,

20:44.000 --> 20:45.000
when you open the console,

20:45.000 --> 20:46.000
you do not see anything here.

20:46.000 --> 20:47.000
Why does this happen?

20:47.000 --> 20:48.000
Because,

20:48.000 --> 20:49.000
here,

20:49.000 --> 20:50.000
the Chrome Scripting API,

20:50.000 --> 20:51.000
that data,

20:51.000 --> 20:52.000
it is not here,

20:52.000 --> 20:55.000
it is logged in the console of the main website.

20:55.000 --> 20:56.000
As soon as you open the main website,

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
and inspect,

20:58.000 --> 20:59.000
and,

20:59.000 --> 21:03.000
as soon as you go inside the console,

21:03.000 --> 21:04.000
so,

21:04.000 --> 21:05.000
why is the data not showing here for now?

21:05.000 --> 21:07.000
Let me check once.

21:07.000 --> 21:08.000
Let's click on Hello World again.

21:08.000 --> 21:09.000
And,

21:09.000 --> 21:10.000
nothing happened here for now.

21:10.000 --> 21:11.000
If something happens,

21:11.000 --> 21:12.000
that your API,

21:12.000 --> 21:13.000
that your extension does not work,

21:13.000 --> 21:14.000
then,

21:14.000 --> 21:15.000
you have to go to Chrome,

21:15.000 --> 21:16.000
forward slash slash extensions,

21:16.000 --> 21:17.000
and,

21:17.000 --> 21:18.000
here,

21:18.000 --> 21:19.000
you have to check,

21:19.000 --> 21:20.000
what errors are coming.

21:20.000 --> 21:21.000
And,

21:21.000 --> 21:22.000
before that,

21:22.000 --> 21:23.000
you can check here also.

21:23.000 --> 21:24.000
Here,

21:24.000 --> 21:25.000
we are not getting any error,

21:25.000 --> 21:26.000
but,

21:26.000 --> 21:27.000
here,

21:27.000 --> 21:28.000
it is saying that,

21:28.000 --> 21:29.000
cannot read properties of undefined.

21:29.000 --> 21:30.000
So,

21:30.000 --> 21:31.000
for now,

21:31.000 --> 21:32.000
it is something like this.

21:32.000 --> 21:33.000
So,

21:33.000 --> 21:34.000
you have removed it.

21:34.000 --> 21:35.000
And,

21:35.000 --> 21:36.000
here,

21:36.000 --> 21:37.000
try to refresh it once.

21:37.000 --> 21:38.000
You refresh it.

21:38.000 --> 21:39.000
After refreshing,

21:39.000 --> 21:40.000
go back to the extension.

21:40.000 --> 21:41.000
And,

21:41.000 --> 21:42.000
now,

21:42.000 --> 21:43.000
you can see,

21:43.000 --> 21:45.000
what data is coming on clicking.

21:45.000 --> 21:47.000
Let's check it once again.

21:47.000 --> 21:48.000
Let's check it.

21:48.000 --> 21:50.000
As we clicked on Hello World,

21:50.000 --> 21:51.000
now also,

21:51.000 --> 21:52.000
there is some issue in the data.

21:52.000 --> 21:53.000
So,

21:53.000 --> 21:56.000
I try to resolve it a little.

21:58.000 --> 22:00.000
I will go back to the code once.

22:00.000 --> 22:01.000
And,

22:01.000 --> 22:03.000
what problem is coming here?

22:03.000 --> 22:04.000
What problem is coming here?

22:04.000 --> 22:05.000
Here,

22:05.000 --> 22:06.000
all these things are there.

22:06.000 --> 22:07.000
We have set it.

22:07.000 --> 22:08.000
We have made this function.

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
We have done everything.

22:10.000 --> 22:11.000
And,

22:11.000 --> 22:12.000
after this,

22:12.000 --> 22:13.000
even after everything is done,

22:13.000 --> 22:14.000
here,

22:14.000 --> 22:15.000
we have summarized.

22:15.000 --> 22:16.000
After summarizing,

22:16.000 --> 22:17.000
this is everything.

22:17.000 --> 22:18.000
We have removed everything.

22:18.000 --> 22:19.000
Let's check it once again

22:19.000 --> 22:20.000
by putting alert.

22:20.000 --> 22:21.000
Crammed.

22:21.000 --> 22:22.000
By text.

22:22.000 --> 22:23.000
We have removed it.

22:23.000 --> 22:24.000
And,

22:24.000 --> 22:25.000
here,

22:25.000 --> 22:26.000
now,

22:26.000 --> 22:27.000
one more,

22:27.000 --> 22:28.000
last try.

22:28.000 --> 22:29.000
And,

22:29.000 --> 22:30.000
here,

22:30.000 --> 22:31.000
you can see,

22:31.000 --> 22:32.000
that,

22:32.000 --> 22:33.000
you can see,

22:33.000 --> 22:34.000
that,

22:34.000 --> 22:35.000
you can see,

22:35.000 --> 22:36.000
that,

22:36.000 --> 22:37.000
you can see,

22:37.000 --> 22:38.000
that,

22:38.000 --> 22:39.000
you can see,

22:39.000 --> 22:40.000
that,

22:40.000 --> 22:41.000
you can see,

22:41.000 --> 22:42.000
that.

22:42.000 --> 22:43.000
If you please.

22:43.000 --> 22:44.000
Let's try one more last time

22:44.000 --> 22:45.000
if we try one last time.

22:47.000 --> 22:49.000
Let's just try it one more time.

22:49.000 --> 22:50.000
If we click on hello word

22:50.000 --> 22:51.000
If we click on hello word

22:51.000 --> 22:52.000
If we click on hello word

22:53.000 --> 22:54.000
and still

22:54.000 --> 22:55.000
some problem

22:55.000 --> 22:56.000
and still some problem

22:56.000 --> 22:57.000
is coming.

22:57.000 --> 22:58.000
is coming.

22:58.000 --> 22:59.000
is coming.

22:59.000 --> 23:00.000
is coming.

23:00.000 --> 23:01.000
is coming.

23:04.000 --> 23:06.000
Scrap Page Content.

23:06.000 --> 23:07.000
Here is a problem

23:07.000 --> 23:08.000
Scrap Page Content

23:08.000 --> 23:09.000
here is a problem

23:09.000 --> 23:13.680
cannot read properties of undefined reading execute script so

23:13.680 --> 23:21.500
I just remembered one thing here that you have to give permission for scripting

23:21.500 --> 23:25.760
and tabs to use execute script method in manifest.json

23:25.760 --> 23:32.160
so this thing slips a lot of time from the mind

23:32.160 --> 23:36.780
but you have to remember so what we do is first of all we go back to our

23:36.780 --> 23:42.420
vscode and here we will go to public folder and open manifest.json

23:42.420 --> 23:47.280
the permissions are active tab and below that you have to put a permission called tabs

23:47.280 --> 23:53.280
tabs permission and below that you have to put a permission for scripting

23:53.280 --> 24:01.280
you put this permission once and after that we go back and check

24:01.280 --> 24:06.020
and now we update it once

24:06.020 --> 24:11.660
and after that we go to hello world and click and now see that this is the full content

24:11.660 --> 24:17.660
it has been scraped and here you can see that the full content is being shown here

24:17.660 --> 24:22.660
so this is the requirement of permissions and it is important for us to keep this in mind

24:22.660 --> 24:27.660
because we are doing scripting here so it is also important to take scripting permission

24:27.660 --> 24:33.660
so here we have seen that how the content of the web page is being updated

24:33.660 --> 24:35.660
and now we will go back to our vscode and click on update tab and below that you have to put a permission called tabs

24:36.020 --> 24:41.660
and here we have seen that how the content of the web page is being updated
