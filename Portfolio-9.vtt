00:06.000 --> 00:14.000
So now we have seen how Sanity's data store in Sanity Studio looks like, but now let's see how we can put data in it.

00:14.000 --> 00:24.000
So what you have to do first is go to the back-end folder of our portfolio and there is a thing called schemas in it.

00:24.000 --> 00:29.000
In this, you can see that it is index.js. So here in the schemas folder, we will create our different documents.

00:29.000 --> 00:36.000
For example, the user's document, we will create different schemas, that is, the user's schema, the portfolio form's schema.

00:36.000 --> 00:44.000
So what will we put in the user's schema? We will put its name, email, picture, we will put these things.

00:44.000 --> 00:52.000
And in the profile, we will send all the data of the profile form. And in index.js, we store this thing there, so you will know everything.

00:52.000 --> 00:54.000
So what we have to do first?

00:54.000 --> 01:01.000
We have to go to sanity.cli.js and there you will be given a project ID. You have to copy it.

01:01.000 --> 01:09.000
And after this, one more thing, we need one more thing to use Sanity right now.

01:09.000 --> 01:13.000
That is a client file and an API token.

01:13.000 --> 01:20.000
So these things are needed because whenever we call Sanity, we will call using the same client file.

01:20.000 --> 01:23.000
Whether we have to delete, create, or do anything with the data.

01:23.000 --> 01:25.000
So now where will we create the client file?

01:25.000 --> 01:31.000
To create the client file, we will go to our main folder, which is the main folder of our project, that is, this one.

01:31.000 --> 01:33.000
Which one? This folder.

01:33.000 --> 01:39.000
So in this folder, in the source, what will we create in the source?

01:39.000 --> 01:42.000
In the source, we will create client.js.

01:42.000 --> 01:45.000
So we will create a file here by doing client.js.

01:45.000 --> 01:48.000
Client.js.

01:48.000 --> 01:51.000
Now in client.js, we will put these things here.

01:51.000 --> 01:55.000
You will be able to see this.

01:55.000 --> 01:57.000
You have to put this thing in client.js.

01:57.000 --> 01:58.000
What is this thing?

01:58.000 --> 02:00.000
This is basically the client file of Sanity.

02:00.000 --> 02:05.000
So here we have to give the token and project ID and all these things.

02:05.000 --> 02:09.000
So for now, we will put the project ID in the env.

02:09.000 --> 02:12.000
So that is why we have used env here.

02:12.000 --> 02:15.000
So let's go to env and we will write here.

02:15.000 --> 02:17.000
We will make one below.

02:17.000 --> 02:19.000
By Sanity project variable.

02:21.000 --> 02:24.000
Sanity project.

02:24.000 --> 02:26.000
And what else did we do here?

02:26.000 --> 02:30.000
Project OK ID.

02:30.000 --> 02:33.000
And in this, we will put our project ID.

02:33.000 --> 02:34.000
What is your project ID?

02:34.000 --> 02:36.000
This is our project ID.

02:36.000 --> 02:37.000
Okay.

02:37.000 --> 02:39.000
So after this, this thing happened.

02:39.000 --> 02:40.000
And what is the second thing?

02:40.000 --> 02:43.000
Our API token.

02:43.000 --> 02:45.000
For token, we have written white Sanity token.

02:45.000 --> 02:48.000
So we will copy it.

02:48.000 --> 02:49.000
And this is done.

02:49.000 --> 02:51.000
But the API token we have, Sanity token,

02:51.000 --> 02:53.000
where will we get it?

02:53.000 --> 02:56.000
So what do you have to do for token?

02:56.000 --> 03:01.000
You have to go to your browser.

03:01.000 --> 03:03.000
And after going to the browser,

03:03.000 --> 03:05.000
here you have to go to this Sanity.io,

03:05.000 --> 03:07.000
which is the studio, I mean.

03:07.000 --> 03:11.000
In this, you have to go to the project in which we have made your back-end portfolio.

03:11.000 --> 03:13.000
After going to that, you have to go to API.

03:13.000 --> 03:14.000
This is API.

03:14.000 --> 03:16.000
And after going to API,

03:16.000 --> 03:20.000
you have to go to create webhook here.

03:20.000 --> 03:22.000
As soon as you go to create webhook,

03:22.000 --> 03:25.000
so after this, what do you have to do here?

03:25.000 --> 03:30.000
Basically, I think, okay, okay.

03:30.000 --> 03:33.000
So here we have to give a name by doing portfolio.

03:33.000 --> 03:35.000
By doing portfolio, we will give a name.

03:35.000 --> 03:36.000
We will save it.

03:36.000 --> 03:37.000
Okay.

03:37.000 --> 03:39.000
And the URL is hostname.

03:39.000 --> 03:40.000
Okay.

03:40.000 --> 03:41.000
I think it was not here.

03:41.000 --> 03:42.000
Let me check.

03:42.000 --> 03:43.000
Okay.

03:43.000 --> 03:44.000
Sorry.

03:44.000 --> 03:45.000
So what is this?

03:45.000 --> 03:46.000
Add API token.

03:46.000 --> 03:47.000
Okay.

03:47.000 --> 03:48.000
Add API token.

03:48.000 --> 03:49.000
Okay.

03:49.000 --> 03:55.000
So here we have to give the editor's permission.

03:55.000 --> 03:59.000
And access to deploy Sanity Studio and GraphQL APIs to our hosted services.

03:59.000 --> 04:00.000
Okay.

04:00.000 --> 04:01.000
Now, we will give it a name.

04:01.000 --> 04:03.000
As we are giving here.

04:03.000 --> 04:04.000
What?

04:04.000 --> 04:05.000
Portfolio.

04:05.000 --> 04:07.000
By doing portfolio, we will give a name.

04:07.000 --> 04:08.000
And we will save it.

04:08.000 --> 04:10.000
And as soon as we save,

04:10.000 --> 04:11.000
your API token,

04:11.000 --> 04:12.000
this thing,

04:12.000 --> 04:14.000
you will copy it.

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
This token is very private.

04:16.000 --> 04:17.000
Here, using the token,

04:17.000 --> 04:20.000
Sanity determines that you are the real user.

04:20.000 --> 04:23.000
So this token should not be leaked anywhere.

04:23.000 --> 04:24.000
Okay.

04:24.000 --> 04:25.000
We copied it.

04:25.000 --> 04:26.000
After copying,

04:26.000 --> 04:29.000
we will go to our code.

04:29.000 --> 04:31.000
And after going to the code,

04:31.000 --> 04:35.000
we will save it in .env.

04:35.000 --> 04:37.000
So our token is saved here.

04:37.000 --> 04:38.000
Okay.

04:38.000 --> 04:40.000
Now, after this,

04:40.000 --> 04:43.000
we will go to the browser once again.

04:43.000 --> 04:45.000
And here we have to do one more thing.

04:45.000 --> 04:46.000
Which is,

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
we have to add the course origin here.

04:48.000 --> 04:50.000
We add the course origin because,

04:50.000 --> 04:53.000
so that we can tell that,

04:53.000 --> 04:54.000
this service,

04:54.000 --> 04:55.000
from where the request will come,

04:55.000 --> 04:56.000
that is us.

04:56.000 --> 04:57.000
And there is no one else,

04:57.000 --> 05:00.000
who is trying to request us.

05:00.000 --> 05:02.000
So here we will write,

05:02.000 --> 05:10.000
localhost http localhost 5173.

05:10.000 --> 05:11.000
Okay.

05:11.000 --> 05:13.000
This is one.

05:13.000 --> 05:14.000
And after this,

05:14.000 --> 05:15.000
should this origin be allowed?

05:15.000 --> 05:17.000
Should this origin be allowed to send

05:17.000 --> 05:19.000
authenticated requests with a user token session

05:19.000 --> 05:20.000
if you are hosting something?

05:20.000 --> 05:21.000
Okay.

05:21.000 --> 05:22.000
So after this,

05:22.000 --> 05:23.000
you save it here.

05:23.000 --> 05:24.000
And again,

05:24.000 --> 05:27.000
you have to add one more origin.

05:27.000 --> 05:29.000
And here we will add another origin,

05:29.000 --> 05:31.000
that is our localhost.

05:31.000 --> 05:33.000
Save.

05:33.000 --> 05:34.000
We have not yet deployed it,

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
so we are just adding localhost.

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
But when we deploy it tomorrow,

05:38.000 --> 05:40.000
then what will we put here?

05:40.000 --> 05:43.000
We will put the URL of our website here.

05:43.000 --> 05:45.000
So here I could not give this permission.

05:45.000 --> 05:46.000
So in a minute,

05:46.000 --> 05:48.000
I will delete it and once again,

05:48.000 --> 05:49.000
you know,

05:49.000 --> 05:51.000
I will do it quickly.

05:51.000 --> 05:54.000
Okay.

05:54.000 --> 05:55.000
http localhost.

05:55.000 --> 05:56.000
Okay.

05:56.000 --> 05:57.000
Now we will do allow credential.

05:57.000 --> 06:00.000
And then save.

06:00.000 --> 06:01.000
Okay.

06:01.000 --> 06:02.000
After this,

06:02.000 --> 06:04.000
our everything is set.

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
Now you do not need to come here again.

06:06.000 --> 06:09.000
So now we go back.

06:09.000 --> 06:10.000
And after this,

06:10.000 --> 06:12.000
our client file is set up.

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
Now you forget it.

06:14.000 --> 06:15.000
And after this,

06:15.000 --> 06:17.000
we have to come back where?

06:17.000 --> 06:20.000
On our portfolio backend folder.

06:20.000 --> 06:21.000
And after coming here,

06:21.000 --> 06:23.000
you have to go into schemas.

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
You have to come here in index.js.

06:25.000 --> 06:27.000
And you have to create a new file in schemas first.

06:27.000 --> 06:30.000
You will name it

06:30.000 --> 06:35.000
user.js.

06:35.000 --> 06:38.000
You will name it user.js.

06:38.000 --> 06:43.000
And here we will make the data of our user.

06:43.000 --> 06:44.000
Now what is that?

06:44.000 --> 06:45.000
I will show you.

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
We will write something like this here.

06:47.000 --> 06:48.000
This thing.

06:48.000 --> 06:49.000
I have given you this thing in the code section.

06:49.000 --> 06:50.000
It is quite easy.

06:50.000 --> 06:51.000
I will tell you what we have done.

06:51.000 --> 06:52.000
Basically,

06:52.000 --> 06:53.000
what we have done is,

06:53.000 --> 06:55.000
we have created a document.

06:55.000 --> 06:56.000
Now what is a document?

06:56.000 --> 06:57.000
You will also know that very well.

06:57.000 --> 06:59.000
We have given the name of this as user.

06:59.000 --> 07:01.000
We have given the title as user.

07:01.000 --> 07:02.000
That is,

07:02.000 --> 07:03.000
I will show you this very well once.

07:03.000 --> 07:05.000
You will know it very well.

07:05.000 --> 07:08.000
We go to our index.js.

07:08.000 --> 07:10.000
And here we have to import too.

07:10.000 --> 07:12.000
Whatever schema we make,

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
we first import it here.

07:14.000 --> 07:17.000
So import user.

07:17.000 --> 07:19.000
You have to import something like this.

07:19.000 --> 07:21.000
And then you have to put it in here.

07:21.000 --> 07:22.000
User.

07:22.000 --> 07:25.000
Now I will show you what we did.

07:25.000 --> 07:28.000
We went back to our browser.

07:28.000 --> 07:30.000
And you just saw what happened.

07:30.000 --> 07:31.000
You saw what happened.

07:31.000 --> 07:32.000
What did we do now?

07:32.000 --> 07:34.000
Now he was writing something here that

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
no document is created.

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000
But as soon as we made a username over there,

07:38.000 --> 07:39.000
schema,

07:39.000 --> 07:41.000
you just create a document by using user in the content.

07:41.000 --> 07:42.000
That is,

07:42.000 --> 07:56.000
As soon as you click on it, you will see that something has been created here and when you click on the edit button, you will see these fields.

07:56.000 --> 08:12.000
Did you understand what happened? What happened is that the user.js schema that we had created, we had put a field in it, name, user email, user name, picture.

08:13.000 --> 08:21.000
So we have made a schema there. Now we can put some things in these schemas.

08:22.000 --> 08:25.000
So we have basically made a document here.

08:26.000 --> 08:31.000
We have put a user here. We have given a title user. There is no difference in the title. The title is only for us to see.

08:32.000 --> 08:42.000
That is, what is written here, capital user, capital you, right? And after that, here is the capital user, capital you, capital you.

08:43.000 --> 08:52.000
So this is just the name that we can see. Basically, the main thing that works for us is with this name, name and type.

08:53.000 --> 08:55.000
Okay, so by using this name, we can see this name.

08:57.000 --> 08:59.000
We will put data in it and we will retrieve the data from there.

09:00.000 --> 09:05.000
So if we say from sanity that sanity, bring me this field from the document named user, user name.

09:06.000 --> 09:11.000
What will sanity do? Now he knows what he is saying, so he will bring it and give it to you.

09:12.000 --> 09:14.000
Okay, so this is our user.js.

09:15.000 --> 09:21.000
Now, just like this, in the schema, we will make another thing, which is profile.js.

09:22.000 --> 09:25.000
Now we had made user.js to store login data.

09:26.000 --> 09:27.000
To store the user's login data.

09:28.000 --> 09:33.000
So the profile.js that we will make, we will make it to store the data of the user's portfolio form.

09:34.000 --> 09:38.000
So this thing is also given to you. You copy paste this thing here.

09:39.000 --> 09:41.000
So basically, this is also the same. We have given the name by profiling it.

09:42.000 --> 09:46.000
And what will be stored in this? User's email, first name, last name.

09:47.000 --> 09:50.000
And the first thing, you can give any name here, any title, it depends on you.

09:51.000 --> 09:53.000
So we have given something like this, so it should be meaningful basically.

09:53.000 --> 09:58.000
Profile, picture, about, work experience, skill, skill 2, skill 3, skill 4.

09:59.000 --> 10:01.000
We have taken 4 skills from the user, we have taken 4 skills from the user.

10:02.000 --> 10:06.000
We will take the input from the user here.

10:07.000 --> 10:11.000
We will go to our index.js and we will import the profile in this way.

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
Import profile.

10:15.000 --> 10:18.000
And in this way, we will also export the profile.

10:19.000 --> 10:21.000
And we will save this.

10:21.000 --> 10:23.000
After saving, we will go to our sanity once.

10:24.000 --> 10:27.000
And here you will see that a profile has also been created.

10:28.000 --> 10:29.000
A profile has also been created.

10:30.000 --> 10:33.000
As soon as you press in profile, right now we have not sent any document in it.

10:34.000 --> 10:37.000
Because we have not made anything yet, basically.

10:38.000 --> 10:39.000
We have not done anything in the user either.

10:40.000 --> 10:43.000
We have specified in the code that insert this thing in the user.

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
But yes, we can see the fields by pressing this button.

10:47.000 --> 10:49.000
If you press this button, you will know what are the fields in it.

10:49.000 --> 10:55.000
User email, first name, last name, we will store all these things of the user here.

10:56.000 --> 10:57.000
It will write to you here.

10:58.000 --> 10:59.000
Ok.

11:00.000 --> 11:03.000
After this, one more thing.

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
As there is a theme by doing profile.

11:07.000 --> 11:12.000
Here user email, if you save the data of any person, then you will get to know through user email.

11:13.000 --> 11:18.000
That is, the profile section here, if any person's data is stored here,

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
then his email will be written here.

11:21.000 --> 11:23.000
And as soon as you click in his email, his whole data will come.

11:24.000 --> 11:25.000
Ok.

11:26.000 --> 11:29.000
Because we have specified this at the top of the profile.

11:30.000 --> 11:31.000
User email.

11:32.000 --> 11:33.000
So according to user email, data will be shown.

11:34.000 --> 11:35.000
And in user.js, the username is written at the top.

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
So there we will see the username.

11:39.000 --> 11:40.000
Here.

11:41.000 --> 11:42.000
Here you will see the username.

11:43.000 --> 11:44.000
If you click in the username, then the data of that user will come.

11:45.000 --> 11:46.000
Ok.

11:47.000 --> 11:48.000
Ok.

11:49.000 --> 11:50.000
After this, now we have made these things.

11:51.000 --> 11:53.000
That we have made profile, user, all these things.

11:54.000 --> 11:55.000
Now what we have to do?

11:56.000 --> 11:57.000
First of all, we will go to our login page.

11:58.000 --> 12:01.000
After going to the login page, you remember that we have stored the data here.

12:02.000 --> 12:03.000
Where have we stored the data?

12:04.000 --> 12:07.000
We have stored the data in the user info object local storage.

12:08.000 --> 12:09.000
Ok.

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
So now we will not want our data to be saved in the local storage.

12:13.000 --> 12:14.000
Yes, we will want it to be saved in the local storage.

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
But now we will also want our data to be saved in our backend.

12:18.000 --> 12:19.000
We also know that how many users we have.

12:20.000 --> 12:21.000
So what we will do for this?

12:22.000 --> 12:28.000
Here, in the use effect, we will now create the document of sanity.

12:29.000 --> 12:30.000
Ok.

12:31.000 --> 12:32.000
We will create the document of sanity.

12:33.000 --> 12:34.000
User document.

12:35.000 --> 12:36.000
So what you have to do to create the document?

12:37.000 --> 12:38.000
Here.

12:39.000 --> 12:40.000
In the use effect.

12:41.000 --> 12:42.000
Here.

12:43.000 --> 12:44.000
Just below local storage.

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
Just below local storage.

12:47.000 --> 12:48.000
Here you will see one thing.

12:49.000 --> 12:52.000
const doc equals to.

12:53.000 --> 12:54.000
Now here we will create an object.

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
The first thing in the object will be the id.

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
Now in sanity, any data you store.

13:01.000 --> 13:07.000
Any data you store, you have to give a unique id to that data.

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
Now from where will you give a unique id?

13:11.000 --> 13:12.000
You will give a unique id.

13:12.000 --> 13:16.000
Here you will remember, that in local storage, we have stored something by doing a sub.

13:17.000 --> 13:18.000
You might remember it properly.

13:18.000 --> 13:19.000
If not, then I will show you.

13:21.000 --> 13:22.000
That our.

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
That our website.

13:26.000 --> 13:29.000
In this, we have put a sub in local storage.

13:29.000 --> 13:30.000
Here you can see.

13:31.000 --> 13:32.000
Can you see?

13:32.000 --> 13:33.000
We said that it is unique for all the IDs.

13:34.000 --> 13:37.000
So this thing, we will use as an id.

13:38.000 --> 13:40.000
Because it is necessary in sanity.

13:40.000 --> 13:41.000
To specify an id.

13:41.000 --> 13:43.000
when we create an object

13:43.000 --> 13:45.000
so

13:45.000 --> 13:47.000
now we will use this sub as id

13:47.000 --> 13:49.000
so what we will do here id

13:49.000 --> 13:51.000
underscore id underscore is necessary

13:51.000 --> 13:53.000
and here we will write user info

13:53.000 --> 13:55.000
dot

13:55.000 --> 13:57.000
sub now what is user info

13:57.000 --> 13:59.000
now i will tell you what is user info

13:59.000 --> 14:01.000
which we have set here

14:01.000 --> 14:03.000
you will remember after success

14:03.000 --> 14:05.000
we have stored user info here

14:05.000 --> 14:07.000
we will remove sub from inside

14:07.000 --> 14:09.000
second thing is type

14:09.000 --> 14:11.000
now what is type

14:11.000 --> 14:13.000
type will be

14:13.000 --> 14:15.000
your user

14:15.000 --> 14:17.000
in which data set

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
in which schema

14:19.000 --> 14:21.000
you have to save this data

14:21.000 --> 14:23.000
so we will save it in user schema

14:23.000 --> 14:25.000
so do you see our user.js

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
we have to save in this

14:27.000 --> 14:29.000
in this document

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
you have put type user

14:31.000 --> 14:33.000
after this user name

14:33.000 --> 14:35.000
you will remember

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
inside user we have made user name

14:37.000 --> 14:39.000
we will write user name

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
what is our user name

14:41.000 --> 14:43.000
user info dot

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
name

14:45.000 --> 14:47.000
inside user info there is a name

14:47.000 --> 14:49.000
in that

14:49.000 --> 14:51.000
and user email

14:51.000 --> 14:53.000
user

14:53.000 --> 14:55.000
email

14:55.000 --> 14:57.000
what is user email

14:57.000 --> 14:59.000
user info

14:59.000 --> 15:01.000
dot email

15:01.000 --> 15:03.000
ok in the same way

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
one more thing is user picture

15:05.000 --> 15:07.000
user picture which we will remember

15:07.000 --> 15:09.000
which gives us a google link

15:09.000 --> 15:11.000
we will store that too

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
and inside user.js we have defined

15:13.000 --> 15:15.000
user picture user email

15:15.000 --> 15:17.000
what is user picture

15:17.000 --> 15:19.000
user info dot

15:19.000 --> 15:21.000
user

15:21.000 --> 15:23.000
info dot picture

15:23.000 --> 15:25.000
nice

15:25.000 --> 15:27.000
now what we have done

15:27.000 --> 15:29.000
we have done nothing

15:29.000 --> 15:31.000
we have made an object

15:31.000 --> 15:33.000
named doc

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
and inside that we have specified some things

15:35.000 --> 15:37.000
like id type user name

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
user email user picture

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
now what we will do

15:41.000 --> 15:43.000
now we will call the client of sanity

15:43.000 --> 15:45.000
and we will push it from sanity

15:45.000 --> 15:47.000
so as soon as all these things come to him

15:47.000 --> 15:49.000
he will immediately store it in sanity

15:49.000 --> 15:51.000
how will that thing be

15:51.000 --> 15:53.000
that thing will be something like this

15:53.000 --> 15:55.000
let me tell you

15:55.000 --> 15:57.000
here

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
I will clear these things

15:59.000 --> 16:01.000
and I will show you

16:01.000 --> 16:03.000
see this

16:03.000 --> 16:05.000
what is this

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
see this

16:07.000 --> 16:09.000
if not exist

16:09.000 --> 16:11.000
there is a function of sanity

16:11.000 --> 16:13.000
now what is client

16:13.000 --> 16:15.000
client is our file

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
so we have to import it

16:17.000 --> 16:19.000
so what will we do to import it

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
control space

16:21.000 --> 16:23.000
and we have imported the client file

16:23.000 --> 16:25.000
this client file is needed

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
whenever you create an object

16:27.000 --> 16:29.000
create a document

16:29.000 --> 16:31.000
you write client dot create if not exist

16:31.000 --> 16:33.000
if the user of this name does not exist

16:33.000 --> 16:35.000
already all these details

16:35.000 --> 16:37.000
do not exist in the user

16:37.000 --> 16:39.000
if the user of this name has been created once

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
then you will not want that

16:41.000 --> 16:43.000
if he comes to login again

16:43.000 --> 16:45.000
then he should be saved again

16:45.000 --> 16:47.000
you will want that

16:47.000 --> 16:49.000
that document should be saved only once

16:49.000 --> 16:51.000
you will not want to save that document 100 times

16:51.000 --> 16:53.000
so you will write create if not exist

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
what does this do

16:55.000 --> 16:57.000
it creates the document only once

16:57.000 --> 16:59.000
if that user is not already created

16:59.000 --> 17:01.000
ok

17:01.000 --> 17:03.000
and what did you give in this

17:03.000 --> 17:05.000
in this function you gave doc

17:05.000 --> 17:07.000
what is doc this document

17:07.000 --> 17:09.000
then it will send a request

17:09.000 --> 17:11.000
it will ask you to create the document

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
and as soon as the document is created

17:13.000 --> 17:15.000
it will store the response in the result

17:15.000 --> 17:17.000
and it will print

17:17.000 --> 17:19.000
that the document is created

17:19.000 --> 17:21.000
if it was already

17:21.000 --> 17:23.000
otherwise it is already present

17:23.000 --> 17:25.000
and we

17:25.000 --> 17:27.000
the response will return us

17:27.000 --> 17:29.000
what all things it has stored

17:29.000 --> 17:31.000
so we have printed it

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
and as soon as the object is created

17:33.000 --> 17:35.000
sorry as soon as

17:35.000 --> 17:37.000
the document is created

17:37.000 --> 17:39.000
the user goes to forward slash

17:39.000 --> 17:41.000
so what used to happen

17:41.000 --> 17:43.000
it used to save in local storage

17:43.000 --> 17:45.000
but now we have said that

17:45.000 --> 17:47.000
after the document is created

17:47.000 --> 17:49.000
it is going to forward slash

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
ok

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
now we do one thing

17:53.000 --> 17:55.000
now we go to our website

17:55.000 --> 17:57.000
and we first log out

17:57.000 --> 17:59.000
we are done from here

17:59.000 --> 18:01.000
we have logged out

18:01.000 --> 18:03.000
now we do continue as techy

18:03.000 --> 18:05.000
and as soon as we do this

18:05.000 --> 18:07.000
we do control shift i

18:07.000 --> 18:09.000
we also see the console

18:09.000 --> 18:11.000
so you will see here

18:11.000 --> 18:13.000
as soon as the document is created

18:13.000 --> 18:15.000
we have come

18:15.000 --> 18:17.000
we have come to our portfolio page

18:17.000 --> 18:19.000
and now what we do

18:19.000 --> 18:21.000
we go to sanity

18:21.000 --> 18:23.000
as soon as we go to sanity

18:23.000 --> 18:25.000
a person named techy recon

18:25.000 --> 18:27.000
has come inside the user

18:27.000 --> 18:29.000
as soon as you click on techy recon

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
you will see all the details

18:31.000 --> 18:33.000
user name, user email, user picture

18:33.000 --> 18:35.000
everything has come

18:35.000 --> 18:37.000
inside techy recon

18:37.000 --> 18:39.000
you can understand

18:39.000 --> 18:41.000
how easy it is

18:41.000 --> 18:43.000
you did nothing

18:43.000 --> 18:45.000
you just set up the client file

18:45.000 --> 18:47.000
and just created the document

18:47.000 --> 18:49.000
using its function

18:49.000 --> 18:51.000
you created the document

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
using this function

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
and now you can fetch it from anywhere

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
it is right here

18:57.000 --> 18:59.000
I will also tell you how to fetch

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
so now our login

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
is set up

19:03.000 --> 19:05.000
now after this

19:05.000 --> 19:07.000
we will add some more things

19:07.000 --> 19:09.000
so now we have set up the login

19:09.000 --> 19:11.000
now we will go to our main page

19:11.000 --> 19:13.000
and in the main page

19:13.000 --> 19:15.000
we will verify

19:15.000 --> 19:17.000
what we did till now

19:17.000 --> 19:19.000
that the user is logged in

19:19.000 --> 19:21.000
and we were checking everything

19:21.000 --> 19:23.000
with local storage

19:23.000 --> 19:25.000
so to make it more strong

19:25.000 --> 19:27.000
we will check sanity

19:27.000 --> 19:29.000
we will say that the email in local storage

19:29.000 --> 19:31.000
and the email in sanity

19:31.000 --> 19:33.000
is it the same

19:33.000 --> 19:35.000
if it is the same

19:35.000 --> 19:37.000
then the user is verified

19:37.000 --> 19:39.000
so now we will see

19:39.000 --> 19:41.000
how it works
