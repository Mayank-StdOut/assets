00:06.000 --> 00:14.000
So, to make React Chrome Extension, the first thing you have to do is to go to the link given to you.

00:14.000 --> 00:18.000
And there you will get a GitHub page.

00:18.000 --> 00:22.000
Here you will see a code button of green color in which the code will be written.

00:22.000 --> 00:24.000
You have to click on it.

00:24.000 --> 00:28.000
And you have to download it by clicking on the download zip written below.

00:28.000 --> 00:30.000
So, what is this? Let's understand this first.

00:30.000 --> 00:34.000
And before that, let's know what is Chrome Extension.

00:34.000 --> 00:38.000
So, see, you download any app on your phone.

00:38.000 --> 00:40.000
So, why do you download the app?

00:40.000 --> 00:44.000
You have to do any task, then only you use that app.

00:44.000 --> 00:49.000
For example, if you want to book a ticket, then you will download the ticket booking app.

00:49.000 --> 00:52.000
After that, if you want to play a game, then you will download the app to play a game.

00:52.000 --> 00:55.000
After that, if you want to watch cricket, then you will download the app for that.

00:55.000 --> 00:58.000
So, these things are the same, they are utilities.

00:58.000 --> 01:09.000
Similarly, Chrome Extension is also a utility by which you can do some things in Chrome-based browsers.

01:09.000 --> 01:11.000
For example, let me show you.

01:11.000 --> 01:14.000
When you will go to Chrome and search Web Store.

01:14.000 --> 01:17.000
And after searching Web Store, you will go here.

01:17.000 --> 01:23.000
So, this is a Play Store to download Chrome extensions.

01:23.000 --> 01:25.000
Consider it like this.

01:25.000 --> 01:27.000
Here you will get a lot of extensions.

01:28.000 --> 01:33.000
You will get a variety of extensions which you can download and use.

01:33.000 --> 01:37.000
For example, this is an extension called Volume Master.

01:37.000 --> 01:43.000
By downloading this, you can use it to run your videos in Chrome, YouTube videos.

01:43.000 --> 01:46.000
So, you can increase their volume.

01:46.000 --> 01:49.000
If your speaker is not making much sound, then you can increase it.

01:49.000 --> 01:52.000
Similarly, this is a Speed Text Extension.

01:52.000 --> 01:54.000
This is a Scientific Calculator.

01:54.000 --> 01:56.000
So, these are a lot of extensions.

01:56.000 --> 01:57.000
You can install them.

01:57.000 --> 01:59.000
You can install and use them.

01:59.000 --> 02:03.000
So, here we are also making a Chrome Extension.

02:03.000 --> 02:09.000
And you know that this Chrome Extension can summarize the content of any web page and tell you.

02:09.000 --> 02:12.000
So, what do you have to do for this?

02:12.000 --> 02:16.000
First of all, you have to go to your Downloads.

02:16.000 --> 02:18.000
And we have already downloaded it in Downloads.

02:18.000 --> 02:20.000
You have to click on it.

02:20.000 --> 02:25.000
And first of all, I want to transfer this thing from here which I have downloaded in the desktop.

02:25.000 --> 02:28.000
This is called React Extension Boilerplate.

02:28.000 --> 02:29.000
You will get this zip file.

02:29.000 --> 02:31.000
You will extract it.

02:31.000 --> 02:33.000
So, you will get something like this.

02:33.000 --> 02:36.000
You have to put it in the desktop.

02:36.000 --> 02:39.000
And once it is copied in the desktop.

02:39.000 --> 02:41.000
I am going to the desktop.

02:41.000 --> 02:44.000
And here we will see this.

02:44.000 --> 02:46.000
You open it.

02:46.000 --> 02:49.000
And first of all, we will open it in VSCode.

02:49.000 --> 02:52.000
So, open with VSCode.

02:52.000 --> 02:53.000
After opening in VSCode.

02:53.000 --> 02:57.000
Here we will get the basic directory structure.

02:57.000 --> 03:01.000
Now, why did we need to download the file here?

03:01.000 --> 03:04.000
See, when we create our React App.

03:04.000 --> 03:05.000
So, what we used to write?

03:05.000 --> 03:07.000
npx create React App.

03:07.000 --> 03:10.000
So, all these directories used to be created automatically.

03:10.000 --> 03:16.000
But in our Chrome Extension, we need some additional folders and files.

03:16.000 --> 03:18.000
So, where does that come from?

03:18.000 --> 03:21.000
You can't get that from the npx create React App.

03:21.000 --> 03:22.000
So, that's why we have to open it.

03:22.000 --> 03:26.000
So, that's why we have already created those things and given it to you.

03:26.000 --> 03:27.000
And this is universal.

03:27.000 --> 03:29.000
If you will create any extension in the future.

03:29.000 --> 03:31.000
So, you can use this in that.

03:31.000 --> 03:33.000
You don't have to do everything from the beginning.

03:33.000 --> 03:37.000
Because this becomes a very difficult task.

03:37.000 --> 03:40.000
And you don't need to understand it in the belief.

03:40.000 --> 03:42.000
I mean, to understand what is happening.

03:42.000 --> 03:44.000
How is the structure?

03:44.000 --> 03:46.000
For example, what are these additional files?

03:46.000 --> 03:49.000
Because they don't have that much work.

03:49.000 --> 03:51.000
So, what will we do first?

03:51.000 --> 03:55.000
We will go and see what is in the source folder.

03:55.000 --> 03:57.000
In the source, we will get some such files.

03:57.000 --> 03:59.000
In which there will be a public folder also.

03:59.000 --> 04:01.000
In which this will happen.

04:01.000 --> 04:05.000
After this, we will have a pop-up file.

04:05.000 --> 04:08.000
In this, whatever code we will write.

04:08.000 --> 04:10.000
Whatever we will see.

04:10.000 --> 04:12.000
As soon as we open the extension, it will be in it.

04:12.000 --> 04:14.000
What will happen in the background file?

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
That things will be running in any background.

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
See the Chrome Extension.

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
In Chrome Extension, some things work in the background too.

04:21.000 --> 04:24.000
So, we will write that in it.

04:24.000 --> 04:29.000
In the content script, we can put some additional things.

04:29.000 --> 04:31.000
Which we want to do with Chrome Extension.

04:31.000 --> 04:33.000
So, now we don't need it in this project.

04:33.000 --> 04:35.000
And it is not that important.

04:35.000 --> 04:40.000
Now, after this, let's see the app.tsx in the pop-up.

04:40.000 --> 04:43.000
So, this is exactly like our index.js.

04:43.000 --> 04:45.000
Which was in our React app.

04:45.000 --> 04:49.000
Because in this, we will render our other components.

04:49.000 --> 04:52.000
Like here, we have rendered a pop-up component on it.

04:52.000 --> 04:54.000
Now, what is the pop-up component?

04:54.000 --> 04:55.000
Let's see it.

04:55.000 --> 04:57.000
In this, we have basic hello-word text.

04:57.000 --> 05:00.000
When you open the extension, you will see hello-word.

05:00.000 --> 05:03.000
So, in this pop-up, we will put basic text.

05:03.000 --> 05:07.000
So, after this, there are some other things.

05:07.000 --> 05:09.000
For now, let's remove it.

05:09.000 --> 05:11.000
These are some codes.

05:11.000 --> 05:13.000
Let's remove it.

05:13.000 --> 05:15.000
I will save it.

05:15.000 --> 05:17.000
Now, after this.

05:17.000 --> 05:18.000
Have you seen this much?

05:18.000 --> 05:20.000
Now, after this, let's come to the public folder.

05:20.000 --> 05:23.000
In public, there is a file called manifest.json.

05:23.000 --> 05:27.000
This is a very important file for your Chrome Extension.

05:27.000 --> 05:34.000
Because in this, we write all the meta-data of Chrome Extension.

05:34.000 --> 05:38.000
That is, we write all the details of Chrome Extension in it.

05:38.000 --> 05:41.000
And these details go to Chrome.

05:41.000 --> 05:45.000
And it verifies what Chrome Extension wants to do.

05:45.000 --> 05:47.000
What permissions does it need?

05:47.000 --> 05:48.000
Right?

05:48.000 --> 05:50.000
And what are the things?

05:50.000 --> 05:53.000
All of them are defined here.

05:53.000 --> 05:56.000
So, now you must have understood this much.

05:56.000 --> 06:02.000
So, now, basically, you have to see what is written here.

06:02.000 --> 06:04.000
It is written as manifest version 3.

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
So, this manifest.json.

06:06.000 --> 06:08.000
Its version is third.

06:08.000 --> 06:12.000
That is, manifest file was basically in different versions.

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
That is, there were different styles to write it.

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
We used to define it in different versions.

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
Before this, there used to be version 2 of manifest.

06:18.000 --> 06:20.000
So, now it is a very different thing.

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
So, now you must have understood it.

06:22.000 --> 06:25.000
Here we tell what is the name of our extension?

06:25.000 --> 06:26.000
What is the version?

06:26.000 --> 06:27.000
What is the description?

06:27.000 --> 06:29.000
Which icon do we want to use?

06:29.000 --> 06:30.000
Right?

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
What permissions will our Chrome Extension take?

06:32.000 --> 06:37.000
For example, tomorrow you need the permission of the user to show the notification to the user.

06:37.000 --> 06:39.000
So, you have to specify it here.

06:39.000 --> 06:41.000
And this is the permission of the active app.

06:41.000 --> 06:43.000
So, maybe we will know more about this.

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
In the background, we tell that background.json.

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
What are the background files?

06:47.000 --> 06:48.000
What will it run in the background?

06:48.000 --> 06:51.000
So, we have told here that background.js will run.

06:51.000 --> 06:55.000
Which is here in our background script.

06:55.000 --> 06:58.000
So, these are some of the things.

06:58.000 --> 07:02.000
Now here you must be seeing that this minimum chrome version is supported.

07:02.000 --> 07:06.000
So, there should be 92 chrome minimum version to run this extension.

07:06.000 --> 07:10.000
Then where will this content file run?

07:10.000 --> 07:12.000
So, now we are not using so much content file.

07:12.000 --> 07:13.000
So, we do not need it.

07:13.000 --> 07:14.000
And these are some other things.

07:15.000 --> 07:18.000
So, these are also additional.

07:18.000 --> 07:20.000
After this, you will see one thing.

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
Here you will see the file extension.

07:22.000 --> 07:24.000
Which is .tsx.

07:24.000 --> 07:25.000
What is this?

07:25.000 --> 07:30.000
So, basically .tsx extension is of TypeScript.

07:30.000 --> 07:31.000
What is TypeScript?

07:31.000 --> 07:35.000
TypeScript is also basically similar to JavaScript.

07:35.000 --> 07:38.000
TypeScript was developed by Microsoft.

07:38.000 --> 07:43.000
And in TypeScript, you get a little more additional feature than JavaScript.

07:43.000 --> 07:44.000
A little more.

07:44.000 --> 07:46.000
So, basically it is exactly the same.

07:46.000 --> 07:48.000
You do not need to worry at all.

07:48.000 --> 07:50.000
Everything is exactly the same.

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
Like you used to write your JSX.

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
In the same way, you must be writing TSX also.

07:54.000 --> 07:57.000
Because you must have seen here that we are writing the components exactly the same.

07:57.000 --> 07:59.000
You must not have understood any difference.

07:59.000 --> 08:01.000
So, these are some things.

08:01.000 --> 08:04.000
So, now what will we do first?

08:04.000 --> 08:08.000
We will go to our folder where our extension is.

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
We will see that first.

08:10.000 --> 08:13.000
So, this is our desktop.

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
You have to go here first.

08:15.000 --> 08:17.000
Here you have to write CMD first.

08:17.000 --> 08:19.000
CMD.

08:19.000 --> 08:22.000
After this, you have to write npm install.

08:22.000 --> 08:24.000
What will happen with npm install?

08:24.000 --> 08:27.000
The important packages will be installed.

08:27.000 --> 08:31.000
Now, till the time it is being installed, I would like to tell you some more things.

08:31.000 --> 08:34.000
As you can see here.

08:34.000 --> 08:37.000
These are some webpack files.

08:37.000 --> 08:39.000
Something written by webpack.

08:39.000 --> 08:41.000
It configures your Chrome extension.

08:41.000 --> 08:44.000
That means everything will be defined here.

08:44.000 --> 08:47.000
That how everything will run in Chrome extension.

08:47.000 --> 08:48.000
Where everything is kept.

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
Everything will be here.

08:50.000 --> 08:54.000
So, if you think that you make everything from the beginning.

08:54.000 --> 08:57.000
So, you have to do all these things by yourself.

08:57.000 --> 09:00.000
Which is a very time-taking task.

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
Now, here are some more things.

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
Like.

09:04.000 --> 09:06.000
Here you must have seen.

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
In our manifest.json.

09:08.000 --> 09:09.000
We have called here .js.

09:09.000 --> 09:10.000
Background.js.

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
After this, you must be seeing here.

09:13.000 --> 09:15.000
This background script is our typescript file.

09:15.000 --> 09:17.000
It is .ts.

09:17.000 --> 09:19.000
So, why have we written .js here?

09:19.000 --> 09:20.000
So, basically what will happen?

09:20.000 --> 09:23.000
That whatever we have written react.

09:23.000 --> 09:25.000
We will compile all this first.

09:25.000 --> 09:27.000
We will build it.

09:27.000 --> 09:30.000
And then it will give us a build folder.

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
And in it.

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
These typescript files.

09:34.000 --> 09:37.000
These typescript files will be converted automatically in js for you.

09:37.000 --> 09:39.000
You will not have to do anything.

09:39.000 --> 09:40.000
So, you are seeing the wonder of this.

09:40.000 --> 09:45.000
How much your work has been made efficient.

09:45.000 --> 09:47.000
So, let's see here.

09:47.000 --> 09:49.000
It must have been installed once.

09:49.000 --> 09:51.000
Which is done.

09:51.000 --> 09:53.000
Here our installation is completed.

09:53.000 --> 09:55.000
You clear it first.

09:55.000 --> 09:57.000
And here you will write npm run dev.

09:57.000 --> 09:59.000
What will happen with this?

09:59.000 --> 10:02.000
The development server of our chrome extension will start.

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
As we used to do for our react app.

10:04.000 --> 10:07.000
So, first of all, it builds the chrome extension.

10:07.000 --> 10:09.000
And generates a folder named dist.

10:09.000 --> 10:10.000
See here.

10:10.000 --> 10:11.000
You must be seeing here.

10:11.000 --> 10:12.000
A folder named dist.

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
Which has been generated automatically.

10:14.000 --> 10:15.000
In it, all the files.

10:15.000 --> 10:16.000
See here.

10:16.000 --> 10:17.000
background.js

10:17.000 --> 10:19.000
All these are written in this type.

10:19.000 --> 10:20.000
So, you can see here.

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
All the things are made in this type.

10:22.000 --> 10:25.000
It has been generated automatically.

10:25.000 --> 10:26.000
So, you must be able to see all this.

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
Now what do we do?

10:28.000 --> 10:33.000
First of all, we go to our chrome.

10:33.000 --> 10:36.000
And now how do we see this chrome extension?
