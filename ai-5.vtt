00:06.000 --> 00:09.440
Now we will enhance the UI of our extension.

00:09.440 --> 00:13.000
Till now we have done everything in the back-end by using Hello World.

00:13.000 --> 00:20.240
Now we will use its UI so that it can be depicted and shown to the user properly.

00:20.240 --> 00:29.160
First of all, we will create a folder named Components in a pop-up folder which I have already created.

00:29.160 --> 00:32.160
I will delete it once and make it again.

00:32.160 --> 00:43.860
Click on the pop-up and go to the folder section in the top and create a folder named Components.

00:43.860 --> 00:52.160
First of all, you have to create a file named Header.tsx in which we will add the header of our extension.

00:52.160 --> 00:53.860
You have created Header.tsx.

00:53.860 --> 00:57.560
The code of Header.tsx is of 2-3 lines.

00:57.560 --> 00:59.060
You have to create it directly.

00:59.160 --> 01:02.460
You have to pick it up from our code section and add it here.

01:02.460 --> 01:05.460
See, here the code is very simple.

01:05.460 --> 01:10.460
Here we have given the header tag and in that we have given the class name Header.tsx.

01:10.460 --> 01:13.460
And the CSS of pop-up.css will be used here.

01:13.460 --> 01:15.460
And we have added it here by saying welcome.

01:15.460 --> 01:25.460
Now the second thing I would like to tell you is that you must have got the code of pop-up.css in the section and code section.

01:25.460 --> 01:29.160
So now pick up the code of pop-up.css from there as well.

01:29.160 --> 01:31.460
And replace your code with it.

01:31.460 --> 01:37.460
Now here the code of pop-up.css, I will explain to you slowly where it is being used.

01:37.460 --> 01:39.460
So what is being used in Header.tsx right now?

01:39.460 --> 01:40.460
Header text.

01:40.460 --> 01:48.460
So in pop-up.css, what we have added in Header text is that we have basically given it there.

01:48.460 --> 01:52.460
Font style, font size, we have given all these things.

01:52.460 --> 01:56.460
So Header text will be somewhere here.

01:56.460 --> 01:57.160
What is this?

01:57.160 --> 01:58.460
So we have given padding here.

01:58.460 --> 01:59.460
We have given text align center.

01:59.460 --> 02:00.460
We have given background.

02:00.460 --> 02:03.460
So here we have basically given it for text.

02:03.460 --> 02:04.460
This is in Header text.

02:04.460 --> 02:07.460
And in the same way, when we will make footer, we have given this class for that.

02:07.460 --> 02:09.460
So we have added very simple things.

02:09.460 --> 02:11.460
We have gone to Header.tsx.

02:11.460 --> 02:13.460
Here our header has been made.

02:13.460 --> 02:16.460
The second thing you have to make in the component is by doing footer.tsx.

02:16.460 --> 02:18.460
So you will make a file.

02:18.460 --> 02:23.460
Footer.tsx.

02:23.460 --> 02:27.460
Now the code of footer.tsx is also very small and of 2-3 lines.

02:27.460 --> 02:28.460
The same code is also added.

02:28.460 --> 02:29.460
You will get the code.

02:29.460 --> 02:30.460
You will just bring it here and keep it.

02:30.460 --> 02:32.460
So here we have done the same thing that we used to do.

02:32.460 --> 02:37.460
Date, year, ampersand copy is an HTML entity.

02:37.460 --> 02:39.460
What are HTML entities?

02:39.460 --> 02:40.460
Let's see that quickly.

02:40.460 --> 02:43.460
What are HTML entities?

02:43.460 --> 02:46.460
So we have gone here in our browser.

02:46.460 --> 02:51.460
And HTML entities are basically different types of basic small codes.

02:51.460 --> 02:53.460
That is, they are kind of small keywords.

02:53.460 --> 02:55.460
By using which you can enter different symbols.

02:55.460 --> 02:57.460
So the ampersand copy that we have used there.

02:57.460 --> 02:59.460
We had used the ampersand copy.

02:59.460 --> 03:01.460
So that it becomes the copyright symbol.

03:01.460 --> 03:03.460
So what have we done?

03:03.460 --> 03:05.460
So we have searched HTML entities.

03:05.460 --> 03:08.460
We have gone.

03:08.460 --> 03:10.460
And here you will be able to see.

03:10.460 --> 03:12.460
The site which is called Mozilla.

03:12.460 --> 03:14.460
Here you will be able to see that the entities that I have told you about.

03:14.460 --> 03:16.460
What are they?

03:16.460 --> 03:17.460
There are many basic things.

03:17.460 --> 03:18.460
There are keywords.

03:18.460 --> 03:21.460
By using which you can make different things.

03:21.460 --> 03:23.460
Like here you can see that by using ampersand copy.

03:23.460 --> 03:25.460
Copyright has been made.

03:25.460 --> 03:28.460
Similarly, these are all the entities.

03:28.460 --> 03:30.460
So here as you write this.

03:30.460 --> 03:32.460
Then an ampersand becomes automatically.

03:32.460 --> 03:33.460
Or it becomes the end.

03:33.460 --> 03:34.460
If you write this.

03:34.460 --> 03:36.460
Then it becomes a sign of less than.

03:36.460 --> 03:37.460
If you write this.

03:37.460 --> 03:38.460
Then it becomes greater than.

03:38.460 --> 03:39.460
If you write ampersand copy.

03:39.460 --> 03:41.460
Then it becomes the copyright sign.

03:41.460 --> 03:42.460
So you must have understood.

03:42.460 --> 03:44.460
So from here you can also copy.

03:44.460 --> 03:46.460
If you need any other entity tomorrow.

03:46.460 --> 03:47.460
Then you can do it.

03:47.460 --> 03:48.460
After this.

03:48.460 --> 03:51.460
We go back to our code.

03:51.460 --> 03:53.460
And after going here.

03:53.460 --> 03:55.460
We have seen by putting header and footer.

03:55.460 --> 03:57.460
Now once we see our extension.

03:57.460 --> 03:58.460
So we go back.

03:58.460 --> 04:01.460
And once we open our extension.

04:01.460 --> 04:02.460
So here you will see.

04:02.460 --> 04:04.460
That hello world has been written.

04:04.460 --> 04:05.460
After this.

04:05.460 --> 04:08.460
Here the style has not been put.

04:08.460 --> 04:09.460
So why did this happen?

04:09.460 --> 04:10.460
Why our style has not been put?

04:10.460 --> 04:12.460
Because.

04:12.460 --> 04:13.460
Because the problem is.

04:13.460 --> 04:14.460
That we have made hello world.

04:14.460 --> 04:15.460
Sorry.

04:15.460 --> 04:16.460
Footer and header have been made.

04:16.460 --> 04:17.460
Component.

04:17.460 --> 04:19.460
But it will have to be put somewhere.

04:19.460 --> 04:20.460
I mean.

04:20.460 --> 04:21.460
It will have to be shown somewhere.

04:21.460 --> 04:22.460
We have just made the component.

04:22.460 --> 04:23.460
It will also have to be imported.

04:23.460 --> 04:25.460
So this thing came down from my mind.

04:25.460 --> 04:26.460
So what do we do for this?

04:26.460 --> 04:27.460
Let's go back.

04:27.460 --> 04:29.460
We have made header and footer.

04:29.460 --> 04:30.460
Now we will do one thing.

04:30.460 --> 04:31.460
We will go to app.tsx.

04:31.460 --> 04:33.460
We have seen in app.tsx.

04:33.460 --> 04:34.460
Our popup is being rendered here.

04:34.460 --> 04:36.460
The header is above the popup.

04:36.460 --> 04:38.460
So we will do the same here.

04:38.460 --> 04:39.460
Here we have the header.

04:39.460 --> 04:41.460
We will bring the header here.

04:41.460 --> 04:44.460
We have brought the header by doing this.

04:44.460 --> 04:45.460
After this we will go here.

04:45.460 --> 04:48.460
And we will import the footer in this way.

04:48.460 --> 04:49.460
And to import it.

04:49.460 --> 04:51.460
We will select it here.

04:51.460 --> 04:53.460
Press control space.

04:53.460 --> 04:54.460
And hit enter.

04:54.460 --> 04:56.460
So it will be imported automatically.

04:56.460 --> 04:57.460
Same thing here.

04:57.460 --> 04:58.460
Press control space and hit enter.

04:58.460 --> 04:59.460
It is imported.

04:59.460 --> 05:01.460
So now the popup here.

05:01.460 --> 05:03.460
This is basically ours.

05:03.460 --> 05:05.460
In which our hello world etc. is visible.

05:05.460 --> 05:07.460
Now where is this popup being rendered?

05:07.460 --> 05:09.460
In app.tsx.

05:09.460 --> 05:11.460
And what did we do in this?

05:11.460 --> 05:13.460
We just put header above the popup.

05:13.460 --> 05:14.460
And put footer below it.

05:14.460 --> 05:15.460
So what happened?

05:15.460 --> 05:18.460
That header and footer went up and down.

05:18.460 --> 05:21.460
So here by default they will show up and down.

05:21.460 --> 05:22.460
So what do we do now?

05:22.460 --> 05:24.460
Now we go back to our browser.

05:24.460 --> 05:25.460
And now.

05:25.460 --> 05:26.460
And now we open our extension once.

05:26.460 --> 05:27.460
So now see.

05:27.460 --> 05:28.460
What happened here?

05:28.460 --> 05:29.460
Welcome has come and under that footer has come.

05:29.460 --> 05:30.460
You are able to understand now.

05:30.460 --> 05:31.460
Here footer and welcome has come.

05:31.460 --> 05:32.460
And the background style has also changed because of the popup.css.

05:32.460 --> 05:33.460
Now as soon as our main content will go in the middle.

05:33.460 --> 05:34.460
So this footer will automatically come down.

05:34.460 --> 05:35.460
Ok.

05:35.460 --> 05:36.460
So what do we do now?

05:36.460 --> 05:37.460
This basic UI has been made.

05:37.460 --> 05:38.460
Now what do we do?

05:38.460 --> 05:39.460
That we first go to the browser.

05:39.460 --> 05:40.460
And then we go here.

05:40.460 --> 05:41.460
And here we go to.

05:41.460 --> 05:42.460
And here we go here.

05:42.460 --> 05:43.460
And here we go.

05:43.460 --> 05:44.460
Now.

05:44.460 --> 05:45.460
And here.

05:45.460 --> 05:46.460
And here we go.

05:46.460 --> 05:47.460
And here.

05:47.460 --> 05:48.460
And here we go.

05:48.460 --> 05:49.460
And here we go.

05:49.460 --> 05:50.460
And here we go.

05:50.460 --> 05:52.460
So, our basic UI is ready.

05:52.460 --> 05:54.460
Now, what we do is,

05:54.460 --> 05:56.460
first of all, we go and

05:56.460 --> 05:58.460
put a button instead of hello word.

05:58.460 --> 06:00.460
After clicking on it,

06:00.460 --> 06:02.460
the analysis will start.

06:02.460 --> 06:04.460
So, you also

06:04.460 --> 06:06.460
come back to your popup.

06:06.460 --> 06:08.460
After that, go to the bottom.

06:08.460 --> 06:10.460
First, we will create a state.

06:10.460 --> 06:12.460
We will name it as

06:12.460 --> 06:14.460
scraped.

06:14.460 --> 06:16.460
And I am telling you

06:16.460 --> 06:18.460
why you need this state.

06:18.460 --> 06:20.460
So, we have created

06:20.460 --> 06:22.460
this state.

06:22.460 --> 06:24.460
Use

06:24.460 --> 06:26.460
state.

06:26.460 --> 06:28.460
And here,

06:28.460 --> 06:30.460
first of all,

06:30.460 --> 06:32.460
we will show false.

06:32.460 --> 06:34.460
So, what will happen?

06:34.460 --> 06:36.460
We will set here

06:36.460 --> 06:38.460
whether the content has been scraped.

06:38.460 --> 06:40.460
That is, whether the content of the website

06:40.460 --> 06:42.460
that we are doing using the scrape function

06:42.460 --> 06:44.460
has been scraped or not.

06:44.460 --> 06:46.460
According to this, we will change our animation in the UI.

06:46.460 --> 06:48.460
So, I will show you how.

06:48.460 --> 06:50.460
So, we have set it as false.

06:50.460 --> 06:52.460
It has not been scraped yet.

06:52.460 --> 06:54.460
By default, it is a false value set.

06:54.460 --> 06:56.460
Now, we will go to our

06:56.460 --> 06:58.460
chrome.execute

06:58.460 --> 07:00.460
script method.

07:00.460 --> 07:02.460
Here, we will go

07:02.460 --> 07:04.460
to the bottom.

07:04.460 --> 07:06.460
Here, we will create a callback function.

07:06.460 --> 07:08.460
What will happen with this?

07:08.460 --> 07:10.460
I will tell you now.

07:10.460 --> 07:12.460
And here, we will write

07:12.460 --> 07:14.460
set is scraped.

07:14.460 --> 07:16.460
We will put true in it.

07:16.460 --> 07:18.460
Now, what will happen with this? I will tell you.

07:18.460 --> 07:20.460
As soon as the scraping will end,

07:20.460 --> 07:22.460
this function

07:22.460 --> 07:24.460
as soon as it will end,

07:24.460 --> 07:26.460
after that, this thing will be called.

07:26.460 --> 07:28.460
And here, the set is scraped will be true.

07:28.460 --> 07:30.460
That is, as soon as the scraping will end,

07:30.460 --> 07:32.460
this thing will be true set.

07:32.460 --> 07:34.460
Now, what will we do with this?

07:34.460 --> 07:36.460
We have said that the set is scraped.

07:36.460 --> 07:38.460
We have set it true.

07:38.460 --> 07:40.460
So, what will we do?

07:40.460 --> 07:42.460
Now, what will we do with this?

07:42.460 --> 07:44.460
Basically, we will put an image tag here.

07:44.460 --> 07:46.460
And here, we will make a button.

07:46.460 --> 07:48.460
Now, what will be the button?

07:48.460 --> 07:50.460
Here, our button will be icon128.png.

07:50.460 --> 07:52.460
This one.

07:52.460 --> 07:54.460
We will use this as our button.

07:54.460 --> 07:56.460
So, as soon as the user will click in this,

07:56.460 --> 07:58.460
after this, the analysis will start.

07:58.460 --> 08:00.460
So, now we will go in this.

08:00.460 --> 08:02.460
We have asked the source.

08:02.460 --> 08:04.460
So, dot forward slash icon128.png

08:04.460 --> 08:06.460
because it is in the current folder.

08:06.460 --> 08:08.460
Dot png

08:08.460 --> 08:10.460
And after this, the alternative

08:10.460 --> 08:12.460
it has written alt.

08:12.460 --> 08:14.460
So, here you will write summary.

08:14.460 --> 08:16.460
This is summarize.

08:16.460 --> 08:18.460
After this.

08:18.460 --> 08:20.460
It is very easy.

08:20.460 --> 08:22.460
On click.

08:22.460 --> 08:24.460
Now, as soon as the button clicks the photo,

08:24.460 --> 08:26.460
the summarize function should work.

08:26.460 --> 08:28.460
So, here we have added this.

08:28.460 --> 08:30.460
Now, here comes the turn

08:30.460 --> 08:32.460
to change the animation.

08:32.460 --> 08:34.460
How will that happen?

08:34.460 --> 08:36.460
Now, I will tell you.

08:36.460 --> 08:38.460
First, do it in the class name.

08:38.460 --> 08:40.460
In the class name, you have to write is scraped.

08:40.460 --> 08:42.460
Is scraped.

08:42.460 --> 08:44.460
Question mark.

08:44.460 --> 08:46.460
If content is scraped.

08:46.460 --> 08:48.460
Content is scraped.

08:48.460 --> 08:50.460
If content is scraped.

08:50.460 --> 08:52.460
Then the class that will be set

08:52.460 --> 08:54.460
will be set as afterscape.

08:54.460 --> 08:56.460
Now, here I will tell you what I am doing.

08:56.460 --> 08:58.460
The afterscape class will be set.

08:58.460 --> 09:00.460
There is double underscore in it.

09:00.460 --> 09:02.460
After this.

09:02.460 --> 09:04.460
Otherwise, the normal class will be

09:04.460 --> 09:06.460
summarized.

09:06.460 --> 09:08.460
The normal class will be

09:08.460 --> 09:10.460
summarized by clicking the button.

09:10.460 --> 09:12.460
Now, what is happening here?

09:12.460 --> 09:14.460
Let's see it once.

09:14.460 --> 09:16.460
So, what have we done?

09:16.460 --> 09:18.460
Here, we have given the class name of the image.

09:18.460 --> 09:20.460
We have

09:20.460 --> 09:22.460
automatically

09:22.460 --> 09:24.460
changed it

09:24.460 --> 09:26.460
according to the situations.

09:26.460 --> 09:28.460
That is,

09:28.460 --> 09:30.460
if the content is not scraped.

09:30.460 --> 09:32.460
Suppose, the user has not clicked the button yet.

09:32.460 --> 09:34.460
So, the normal class with the

09:34.460 --> 09:36.460
summarized button will be put in it.

09:36.460 --> 09:38.460
Now, the class with the summarized button.

09:38.460 --> 09:40.460
Let's see its popup once.

09:40.460 --> 09:42.460
Let's see its style.

09:42.460 --> 09:44.460
So, if you see its style.

09:44.460 --> 09:46.460
It is something like this.

09:46.460 --> 09:48.460
This is the work of the summarized button.

09:48.460 --> 09:50.460
So, you will get this at the top.

09:50.460 --> 09:52.460
Summarized button.

09:52.460 --> 09:54.460
What is this?

09:54.460 --> 09:56.460
So, here we have told that where to place the image.

09:56.460 --> 09:58.460
That the margin has to be given

09:58.460 --> 10:00.460
46% from the top.

10:00.460 --> 10:02.460
The auto has to be given from the side so that it is in the center.

10:02.460 --> 10:04.460
Display flex has to be given.

10:04.460 --> 10:06.460
The align item has to be given in the center.

10:06.460 --> 10:08.460
So, we have told it that it should come in the center.

10:08.460 --> 10:10.460
What is the page's photo?

10:10.460 --> 10:12.460
So, if it has not clicked till now, then it will be in the center of the page.

10:12.460 --> 10:14.460
But as soon as it clicks.

10:14.460 --> 10:16.460
As soon as it clicks, then the content

10:16.460 --> 10:18.460
starts here.

10:18.460 --> 10:20.460
And as soon as the content is scraped,

10:20.460 --> 10:22.460
then we put this class.

10:22.460 --> 10:24.460
That means the content has been scraped.

10:24.460 --> 10:26.460
So, in popup.css, let's see the after scrape class.

10:26.460 --> 10:28.460
So, see this.

10:28.460 --> 10:30.460
In after scrape, we have put an animation by doing slide left.

10:30.460 --> 10:32.460
What will happen with this?

10:32.460 --> 10:34.460
That the animation of slide left

10:34.460 --> 10:36.460
will lift the photo from the center of the page

10:36.460 --> 10:38.460
and slide it towards the left.

10:38.460 --> 10:40.460
There will be an animation.

10:40.460 --> 10:42.460
So, see this. 0%.

10:42.460 --> 10:44.460
That means in the beginning, the image is in the center.

10:44.460 --> 10:46.460
But as soon as the animation is applied,

10:46.460 --> 10:48.460
then it will go minus 300%

10:48.460 --> 10:50.460
to the left.

10:50.460 --> 10:52.460
That means it will disappear from the page.

10:52.460 --> 10:54.460
And this will happen with the speed of 0.9 seconds.

10:54.460 --> 10:56.460
Do you understand?

10:56.460 --> 10:58.460
So, here you must have understood that

10:58.460 --> 11:00.460
as soon as the content is scraped and the button is clicked,

11:00.460 --> 11:02.460
then the photo will slide to the left.

11:02.460 --> 11:04.460
So, from here,

11:04.460 --> 11:06.460
we have found out this.

11:06.460 --> 11:08.460
Now, let's check this thing once.

11:08.460 --> 11:10.460
Chrome extension.

11:10.460 --> 11:12.460
So, now we have come here.

11:12.460 --> 11:14.460
See, now everything is fine.

11:14.460 --> 11:16.460
Here, our

11:16.460 --> 11:18.460
button has come.

11:18.460 --> 11:20.460
The footer has been set well below.

11:20.460 --> 11:22.460
The header has been set well above.

11:22.460 --> 11:24.460
The hello word is still written because we have not removed it.

11:24.460 --> 11:26.460
Now, what do we do with this?

11:26.460 --> 11:28.460
As soon as we click,

11:28.460 --> 11:30.460
now what will happen?

11:30.460 --> 11:32.460
This click has not been clicked yet.

11:32.460 --> 11:34.460
So, the class of summarize button is active in this.

11:34.460 --> 11:36.460
As soon as we click, the class of after scrape will come.

11:36.460 --> 11:38.460
Because the content will be scraped by the time.

11:38.460 --> 11:40.460
Because it is a real-time process.

11:40.460 --> 11:42.460
So, this slide will go to the left.

11:42.460 --> 11:44.460
As soon as we click, it slides to the left.

11:44.460 --> 11:46.460
Now, what do we want?

11:46.460 --> 11:48.460
It slides to the left.

11:48.460 --> 11:50.460
But now the scraped content will go to the open area.

11:50.460 --> 11:52.460
So, till then, we have to show the load.

11:52.460 --> 11:54.460
The content is loading.

11:54.460 --> 11:56.460
So, now we will put a loader.

11:56.460 --> 11:58.460
We call it pulse loader.

11:58.460 --> 12:00.460
We will put that here.

12:00.460 --> 12:02.460
So, now what do we do first?

12:02.460 --> 12:04.460
Let's go back to the code.

12:04.460 --> 12:06.460
And

12:06.460 --> 12:08.460
after going to the code, we will do one thing here.

12:08.460 --> 12:10.460
The div that we have given here,

12:10.460 --> 12:11.980
the hello word one, we remove it first.

12:12.460 --> 12:14.460
So, we don't need the hello word one now.

12:14.460 --> 12:16.460
Now, what we will do is

12:16.460 --> 12:18.460
that now

12:18.460 --> 12:20.460
a small org code

12:20.460 --> 12:22.460
will be basically given

12:22.460 --> 12:24.460
in the code section.

12:24.460 --> 12:26.460
So, you don't have to do anything.

12:26.460 --> 12:28.460
You just have to pick it up and paste it.

12:28.460 --> 12:30.460
Now, what is this?

12:30.460 --> 12:32.460
I will tell you this once.

12:32.460 --> 12:34.460
So,

12:34.460 --> 12:36.460
see here

12:36.460 --> 12:38.460
what we have done.

12:38.460 --> 12:40.460
We have put some conditions here.

12:40.460 --> 12:42.460
You must have understood the image one.

12:42.460 --> 12:44.460
We have set a new summary here.

12:44.460 --> 12:46.460
Summary means

12:46.460 --> 12:48.460
when the content was analyzed.

12:48.460 --> 12:50.460
So, we said that

12:50.460 --> 12:52.460
if the summary.length is greater than zero,

12:52.460 --> 12:54.460
that means there is something in the summary.

12:54.460 --> 12:56.460
That means, if there is something in the summary,

12:56.460 --> 12:58.460
then we will normally show the summary

12:58.460 --> 13:00.460
here.

13:00.460 --> 13:02.460
Normally, we have shown the summary here.

13:02.460 --> 13:04.460
But

13:04.460 --> 13:06.460
until the summary is not there

13:06.460 --> 13:08.460
and the content is scraped,

13:08.460 --> 13:10.460
but the summary has not come,

13:10.460 --> 13:12.460
then we will put the loader pulse here.

13:12.460 --> 13:14.460
So, we will show the content

13:14.460 --> 13:16.460
in this way.

13:16.460 --> 13:18.460
See here.

13:18.460 --> 13:20.460
So, we have put the condition

13:20.460 --> 13:22.460
here.

13:22.460 --> 13:24.460
As the summary.length is greater than zero,

13:24.460 --> 13:26.460
that means the summary comes,

13:26.460 --> 13:28.460
then the summary will show something like this.

13:28.460 --> 13:30.460
But until the summary does not come,

13:30.460 --> 13:32.460
until the content is scraped,

13:32.460 --> 13:34.460
then only the loader animation

13:34.460 --> 13:36.460
is shown.

13:36.460 --> 13:38.460
And whatever the CSS of the loader animation is in the pop-up,

13:38.460 --> 13:40.460
then everything is given here.

13:40.460 --> 13:42.460
Basically, how will the load be?

13:42.460 --> 13:44.460
It is a very basic animation.

13:44.460 --> 13:46.460
It is a very basic animation.

13:46.460 --> 13:48.460
So, here it is.

13:48.460 --> 13:50.460
Where is the loader pulse animation?

13:50.460 --> 13:52.460
That is your basic animation.

13:52.460 --> 13:54.460
You will see it by pulsing.

13:54.460 --> 13:56.460
So, here we are just increasing the opacity.

13:56.460 --> 13:58.460
So, we are increasing the opacity.

13:58.460 --> 14:00.460
So, due to this, it seems that it is loading.

14:00.460 --> 14:02.460
So, now we will show you nicely.

14:02.460 --> 14:04.460
Now, here

14:04.460 --> 14:06.460
this thing is ready.

14:06.460 --> 14:08.460
Now, what do we do once?

14:08.460 --> 14:10.460
Let's go back to our extension.

14:10.460 --> 14:12.460
Ok.

14:12.460 --> 14:14.460
One minute.

14:14.460 --> 14:16.460
Here is our browser.

14:16.460 --> 14:18.460
And we go back to our extension.

14:18.460 --> 14:20.460
Now, let's see how clear and clean our extension is.

14:20.460 --> 14:22.460
Now, let's see how clear and clean our extension is.

14:22.460 --> 14:24.460
We put a header above and a footer below.

14:24.460 --> 14:26.460
We put buttons in the middle and gave it a style.

14:26.460 --> 14:28.460
As soon as we click, what will happen first?

14:28.460 --> 14:30.460
It will check whether the content has been scraped or not.

14:30.460 --> 14:32.460
So, as soon as you click, the content is scraped.

14:32.460 --> 14:34.460
So, it will slide to the left immediately.

14:34.460 --> 14:36.460
Animation will be applied.

14:36.460 --> 14:38.460
As soon as it slides, you can see

14:38.460 --> 14:40.460
that the loader animation has come automatically.

14:40.460 --> 14:42.460
So, what does the loader animation do?

14:42.460 --> 14:44.460
It tells that the content is loading.

14:44.460 --> 14:46.460
Now, as soon as it loads,

14:46.460 --> 14:48.460
the summary dot length becomes greater than zero.

14:48.460 --> 14:50.460
So, here it shows the summary.

14:50.460 --> 14:52.460
So, here it shows the summary.

14:52.460 --> 14:54.460
It was very basic and very easy.

14:54.460 --> 14:56.460
And here the summary has come very nicely.

14:56.460 --> 14:58.460
So, this was our basic extension part

14:58.460 --> 15:00.460
where we enhanced the UI.

15:00.460 --> 15:02.460
where we enhanced the UI.
