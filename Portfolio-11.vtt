00:06.000 --> 00:29.980
So now we will see that the data of our form, portfolio form, which we will fill from the user, how can we save it in sanity, so we have to do the same thing that we have to create a document and push it in sanity, so now I would like to show you one more thing for this, this is a website in which the documentation of sanity is kind of given,

00:30.000 --> 00:58.240
so this is npmjs.com, so in this you will get everything that these functions are there, like create document, create if not exist, update document, all the functions that are there for sanity, they will be given to you here, so if tomorrow you need any function, then you can see from here, for example, how to create and replace a document, so if you go here, then it will give you this method that this is your document, if you want to create and replace it in sanity, then you can use this function and you can do it,

00:58.240 --> 00:59.440
ok,

01:00.000 --> 01:28.980
and now we will use the same method for our form, what does create and replace do, what does create and replace do is that if the user's document is already closed, then it will replace it, but if that document is not made, then it will create it, that is, suppose there is a profile page for someone, you get the option to edit in the profile page, right, so when you edit, your information changes, how does it happen,

01:30.000 --> 01:57.820
and if a new information is saved in the database, it is edited and replaced with new information, the same thing does this too, if a user's portfolio is form-data, which is form-data, then it will add form data, otherwise if there is form-data and if the user has added any new information, then it will replace it, it is very easy, right, so this is just this, and then there are some more things, create if not exist, which we have used, right, that if there is no document, then it will create it, if there is no document, then it will replace it, so in this way you can do this method, ok,

02:00.000 --> 02:06.000
After that, there is an update option here that you can update.

02:06.000 --> 02:11.000
After updating, there are some other things that you can do.

02:11.000 --> 02:13.000
So now we go back to the code.

02:13.000 --> 02:18.000
So now we complete our handleSummit function.

02:18.000 --> 02:23.000
For this, we will first put a parameter in it, which is called event.

02:23.000 --> 02:32.000
Because here we are going to put the data of the form.

02:32.000 --> 02:35.000
And finally, when we submit the form,

02:35.000 --> 02:37.000
this handleSummit function will be called here.

02:37.000 --> 02:40.000
Where? OnSummit.

02:40.000 --> 02:49.000
So when it will call onSummit, we will store the values of our input fields.

02:49.000 --> 02:53.000
So there we will store the values of those fields.

02:53.000 --> 02:57.000
We will store them in an object named data.

02:57.000 --> 02:59.000
So how will this happen here?

02:59.000 --> 03:04.000
We will use the name here to select the input fields.

03:04.000 --> 03:08.000
And the respective values that we will put in these names,

03:08.000 --> 03:12.000
we will take them as a value that we will be putting in the values.

03:12.000 --> 03:15.000
So what will be our key? It will be our name.

03:15.000 --> 03:16.000
So first name.

03:16.000 --> 03:18.000
And the value you will put in the first name, for example, John.

03:18.000 --> 03:21.000
So John will be its key value.

03:21.000 --> 03:23.000
So in this way, we will be storing it on the key value.

03:23.000 --> 03:25.000
So now what we will do is,

03:25.000 --> 03:29.000
we have put the event in our handleSummit function.

03:29.000 --> 03:31.000
We will want one more thing for this.

03:31.000 --> 03:33.000
When the form is submitted,

03:33.000 --> 03:35.000
our form should not be reloaded.

03:35.000 --> 03:37.000
The page should not be reloaded.

03:37.000 --> 03:39.000
So by doing preventDefault,

03:39.000 --> 03:41.000
there is a functionality called preventDefault,

03:41.000 --> 03:43.000
event.preventDefault.

03:43.000 --> 03:45.000
So we can put that thing here.

03:45.000 --> 03:48.000
So that our form should not be loaded.

03:48.000 --> 03:50.000
That is, it should not be reloaded.

03:50.000 --> 03:51.000
And after this,

03:51.000 --> 03:53.000
now we will put one more thing.

03:53.000 --> 03:55.000
That we will want,

03:55.000 --> 03:58.000
our button loading state,

03:58.000 --> 04:00.000
I will tell you what button loading is.

04:00.000 --> 04:02.000
That state is this.

04:02.000 --> 04:03.000
See this.

04:03.000 --> 04:05.000
When a person will click on the submit button,

04:05.000 --> 04:07.000
this is our submit button.

04:07.000 --> 04:09.000
When someone will click on the submit button,

04:09.000 --> 04:11.000
then what will happen is,

04:11.000 --> 04:13.000
what will happen here first is,

04:13.000 --> 04:16.000
the data that will be filled in the form of the user,

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
that will go to sanity.

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
And when that data will be going to sanity,

04:20.000 --> 04:21.000
the document will be being created in sanity,

04:21.000 --> 04:23.000
then it will take some time,

04:23.000 --> 04:25.000
so till the time it is being created,

04:25.000 --> 04:28.000
till then we will show the loading here.

04:28.000 --> 04:31.000
So as soon as the person clicks on submit,

04:31.000 --> 04:33.000
then handleSubmit function will be called.

04:33.000 --> 04:34.000
Right?

04:34.000 --> 04:36.000
Because we have written on the top of the form,

04:36.000 --> 04:37.000
onSubmit.

04:37.000 --> 04:39.000
HandleSubmit function is called.

04:39.000 --> 04:41.000
As soon as handleSubmit function is called,

04:41.000 --> 04:43.000
here we will set its state as loading.

04:43.000 --> 04:45.000
We will set this B loading as true,

04:45.000 --> 04:47.000
so this loading will be shown.

04:47.000 --> 04:49.000
And as soon as the document will be created,

04:49.000 --> 04:51.000
then we will set its state as false.

04:51.000 --> 04:52.000
So as soon as we set false,

04:52.000 --> 04:54.000
then what will happen?

04:54.000 --> 04:55.000
It will come in submit.

04:55.000 --> 04:56.000
You must have understood.

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
So now what do we do here?

04:58.000 --> 04:59.000
Just below this,

04:59.000 --> 05:01.000
set B loading.

05:01.000 --> 05:03.000
And where did we create this state?

05:03.000 --> 05:05.000
It is created here.

05:05.000 --> 05:07.000
This is B loading.

05:07.000 --> 05:08.000
Right?

05:08.000 --> 05:13.000
So we will set it here.

05:13.000 --> 05:15.000
Here.

05:15.000 --> 05:17.000
Set is B loading.

05:17.000 --> 05:20.000
And here we will make it true.

05:20.000 --> 05:21.000
After this,

05:21.000 --> 05:26.000
now here we will capture the data of the form.

05:26.000 --> 05:29.000
We will capture the data of the form.

05:29.000 --> 05:31.000
Here we make a variable named form.

05:31.000 --> 05:32.000
And in it,

05:32.000 --> 05:33.000
event.target,

05:33.000 --> 05:35.000
means all the values that the user will write,

05:35.000 --> 05:36.000
all of them,

05:36.000 --> 05:40.000
we capture an event in the form.

05:40.000 --> 05:46.000
And here we make a constructor by doing a form data.

05:46.000 --> 05:49.000
And I will tell you what we have to do here.

05:49.000 --> 05:50.000
By doing form data.

05:51.000 --> 05:53.000
And here,

05:53.000 --> 06:00.000
equal to new form data.

06:00.000 --> 06:01.000
And in it,

06:01.000 --> 06:03.000
we put the form.

06:03.000 --> 06:04.000
Now what will happen basically?

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
What will this constructor do?

06:06.000 --> 06:09.000
That whatever form data is coming here,

06:09.000 --> 06:13.000
whatever form data is coming from event.target,

06:13.000 --> 06:18.000
all those things will go inside this constructor.

06:18.000 --> 06:19.000
Right?

06:19.000 --> 06:22.000
And then after this,

06:22.000 --> 06:24.000
by doing data,

06:24.000 --> 06:27.000
here we make an object.

06:27.000 --> 06:28.000
Now what will this object do?

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
I will tell you everything now.

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
And here we put a loop.

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
We put for of loop.

06:34.000 --> 06:43.000
For let key and value of form data.

06:43.000 --> 06:44.000
What is form data?

06:44.000 --> 06:45.000
What is this?

06:45.000 --> 06:46.000
This is form data.

06:46.000 --> 06:47.000
Whatever form data is in it,

06:47.000 --> 06:48.000
the constructor in it,

06:48.000 --> 06:50.000
whatever values we have,

06:50.000 --> 06:51.000
it will loop them.

06:51.000 --> 06:53.000
Whatever values we have in form data,

06:53.000 --> 06:54.000
it will loop them.

06:54.000 --> 06:56.000
All the entries in it,

06:56.000 --> 07:00.000
this thing will loop them.

07:00.000 --> 07:01.000
After this,

07:01.000 --> 07:03.000
whatever entries are in it,

07:03.000 --> 07:04.000
whatever values are there,

07:04.000 --> 07:05.000
right?

07:05.000 --> 07:06.000
Whatever values are there,

07:06.000 --> 07:11.000
we will put all of them inside the data.

07:11.000 --> 07:12.000
Now,

07:12.000 --> 07:13.000
what have we done?

07:13.000 --> 07:15.000
Let's understand it one more time.

07:15.000 --> 07:16.000
What have we done?

07:16.000 --> 07:19.000
We have made a form name variable.

07:19.000 --> 07:20.000
In it,

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
whatever value we are getting in event.target,

07:22.000 --> 07:25.000
it will be stored in all of them.

07:25.000 --> 07:27.000
Whatever name value we are getting,

07:27.000 --> 07:28.000
we have made a constructor

07:28.000 --> 07:30.000
and we have assigned form to it.

07:30.000 --> 07:31.000
Form data name.

07:31.000 --> 07:33.000
And whatever value is stored in it,

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
inside it,

07:35.000 --> 07:36.000
we will loop it.

07:36.000 --> 07:37.000
And before that,

07:37.000 --> 07:40.000
we have made an empty object data name.

07:40.000 --> 07:42.000
Now we will loop that form data.

07:42.000 --> 07:43.000
And basically,

07:43.000 --> 07:45.000
we will loop this form data.

07:45.000 --> 07:46.000
And inside it,

07:46.000 --> 07:47.000
whatever key values will be there,

07:47.000 --> 07:48.000
i.e.

07:48.000 --> 07:49.000
what can be the name?

07:49.000 --> 07:50.000
What will be the key value?

07:50.000 --> 07:51.000
In our form,

07:51.000 --> 07:52.000
whatever name is there,

07:52.000 --> 07:53.000
that will be the key.

07:53.000 --> 07:54.000
And whatever value will be there,

07:54.000 --> 07:55.000
the user will write,

07:55.000 --> 07:56.000
that will be the value.

07:56.000 --> 07:57.000
For example,

07:57.000 --> 07:58.000
if we see here,

07:58.000 --> 07:59.000
then our first name,

07:59.000 --> 08:00.000
this is a key.

08:00.000 --> 08:01.000
Right?

08:01.000 --> 08:02.000
Last name,

08:02.000 --> 08:03.000
that is also a key.

08:03.000 --> 08:04.000
After this,

08:04.000 --> 08:05.000
here,

08:05.000 --> 08:06.000
and about,

08:06.000 --> 08:07.000
this is also a key.

08:07.000 --> 08:08.000
So,

08:08.000 --> 08:09.000
these are all the keys.

08:09.000 --> 08:10.000
So,

08:10.000 --> 08:11.000
all these things will be in it,

08:11.000 --> 08:12.000
inside the form data.

08:12.000 --> 08:13.000
Now,

08:13.000 --> 08:14.000
it is looping it.

08:14.000 --> 08:15.000
All the entries in it,

08:15.000 --> 08:16.000
all the things stored in it,

08:16.000 --> 08:17.000
it is looping them.

08:17.000 --> 08:18.000
And it is appending it

08:18.000 --> 08:19.000
inside the data.

08:19.000 --> 08:20.000
It is going to insert it

08:20.000 --> 08:21.000
inside the data.

08:21.000 --> 08:22.000
Right?

08:22.000 --> 08:23.000
So,

08:23.000 --> 08:24.000
it is putting the key

08:24.000 --> 08:25.000
in the data

08:25.000 --> 08:26.000
and it is assigning values to it.

08:26.000 --> 08:27.000
So,

08:27.000 --> 08:28.000
the data,

08:28.000 --> 08:29.000
basically,

08:29.000 --> 08:30.000
our object is being made.

08:30.000 --> 08:31.000
After this,

08:31.000 --> 08:32.000
what will we do?

08:32.000 --> 08:33.000
All the values

08:33.000 --> 08:34.000
that come to us,

08:34.000 --> 08:35.000
so,

08:35.000 --> 08:36.000
we store these values

08:36.000 --> 08:37.000
at one place.

08:37.000 --> 08:38.000
And where

08:38.000 --> 08:39.000
will we store it?

08:39.000 --> 08:40.000
We will store it

08:40.000 --> 08:41.000
in our

08:41.000 --> 08:42.000
form data.

08:42.000 --> 08:43.000
So,

08:43.000 --> 08:44.000
we will store it

08:44.000 --> 08:45.000
inside our

08:45.000 --> 08:46.000
p form data.

08:46.000 --> 08:47.000
We want to see

08:47.000 --> 08:48.000
what values

08:48.000 --> 08:49.000
we have

08:49.000 --> 08:50.000
here.

08:50.000 --> 08:51.000
What is

08:51.000 --> 08:52.000
p form data?

08:52.000 --> 08:53.000
Let me tell you

08:53.000 --> 08:54.000
what is p form data.

08:54.000 --> 08:55.000
p form data is this.

08:55.000 --> 08:56.000
We had made

08:56.000 --> 08:57.000
a state

08:57.000 --> 08:58.000
p form data

08:58.000 --> 08:59.000
by calling it

08:59.000 --> 09:00.000
empty object.

09:00.000 --> 09:01.000
We will store it

09:01.000 --> 09:02.000
inside this.

09:02.000 --> 09:03.000
So,

09:03.000 --> 09:04.000
to store

09:04.000 --> 09:05.000
p form data,

09:05.000 --> 09:06.000
we will go here

09:06.000 --> 09:07.000
and here

09:07.000 --> 09:08.000
we will write

09:08.000 --> 09:09.000
data.

09:09.000 --> 09:10.000
And we have

09:10.000 --> 09:11.000
stored data here.

09:11.000 --> 09:12.000
After this,

09:12.000 --> 09:13.000
we also

09:13.000 --> 09:14.000
have

09:14.000 --> 09:15.000
a

09:15.000 --> 09:16.000
dot

09:16.000 --> 09:17.000
log

09:17.000 --> 09:18.000
and

09:18.000 --> 09:19.000
we

09:19.000 --> 09:20.000
stringify

09:20.000 --> 09:21.000
it.

09:21.000 --> 09:22.000
p form

09:22.000 --> 09:23.000
data.

09:23.000 --> 09:24.000
We have

09:24.000 --> 09:25.000
stringified

09:25.000 --> 09:26.000
it like

09:26.000 --> 09:27.000
this.

09:27.000 --> 09:28.000
Okay.

09:28.000 --> 09:29.000
Once we

09:29.000 --> 09:30.000
see

09:30.000 --> 09:31.000
how it

09:31.000 --> 09:32.000
looks.

09:32.000 --> 09:33.000
And

09:33.000 --> 09:34.000
what

09:34.000 --> 09:35.000
have we

09:35.000 --> 09:36.000
done here?

09:36.000 --> 09:37.000
As soon as

09:37.000 --> 09:38.000
the handle

09:38.000 --> 09:39.000
is submitted,

09:39.000 --> 09:40.000
we have

09:40.000 --> 09:41.000
set our

09:41.000 --> 09:42.000
event

09:42.000 --> 09:43.000
p form entries

09:43.000 --> 09:44.000
in the data.

09:44.000 --> 09:45.000
And then

09:45.000 --> 09:46.000
we have set it

09:46.000 --> 09:47.000
in a state

09:47.000 --> 09:48.000
from the data.

09:48.000 --> 09:49.000
This much

09:49.000 --> 09:50.000
is done.

09:50.000 --> 09:51.000
After this,

09:51.000 --> 09:52.000
the main thing

09:52.000 --> 09:53.000
is to create

09:53.000 --> 09:54.000
a document

09:54.000 --> 09:55.000
of sanity.

09:55.000 --> 09:56.000
Now,

09:56.000 --> 09:57.000
we have

09:57.000 --> 09:58.000
all the data

09:58.000 --> 09:59.000
inside it.

09:59.000 --> 10:00.000
Let's check it

10:00.000 --> 10:01.000
quickly.

10:01.000 --> 10:02.000
Now,

10:02.000 --> 10:03.000
we go to

10:03.000 --> 10:04.000
our

10:04.000 --> 10:05.000
web page.

10:05.000 --> 10:06.000
This is

10:06.000 --> 10:07.000
our

10:07.000 --> 10:08.000
web page,

10:08.000 --> 10:09.000
right?

10:09.000 --> 10:10.000
Now,

10:10.000 --> 10:11.000
we put

10:11.000 --> 10:12.000
hello.

10:12.000 --> 10:13.000
For example,

10:13.000 --> 10:14.000
I put

10:14.000 --> 10:15.000
hello

10:15.000 --> 10:16.000
here.

10:16.000 --> 10:17.000
I put

10:17.000 --> 10:18.000
world.

10:18.000 --> 10:19.000
I

10:19.000 --> 10:20.000
put

10:20.000 --> 10:21.000
how

10:21.000 --> 10:22.000
are you

10:22.000 --> 10:23.000
here.

10:23.000 --> 10:24.000
I put

10:24.000 --> 10:25.000
anything

10:25.000 --> 10:26.000
here.

10:26.000 --> 10:27.000
Here

10:27.000 --> 10:28.000
and

10:28.000 --> 10:29.000
here

10:29.000 --> 10:30.000
I put

10:30.000 --> 10:31.000
web

10:31.000 --> 10:32.000
death.

10:32.000 --> 10:33.000
And

10:33.000 --> 10:34.000
I do

10:34.000 --> 10:35.000
this thing

10:35.000 --> 10:36.000
like this.

10:36.000 --> 10:37.000
Probe.

10:37.000 --> 10:38.000
And

10:38.000 --> 10:39.000
here

10:39.000 --> 10:40.000
I do

10:40.000 --> 10:41.000
this.

10:41.000 --> 10:42.000
I put

10:42.000 --> 10:43.000
three

10:43.000 --> 10:44.000
and here

10:44.000 --> 10:45.000
and here

10:45.000 --> 10:46.000
abcd.

10:46.000 --> 10:47.000
Okay,

10:47.000 --> 10:48.000
we put

10:48.000 --> 10:49.000
this thing for now.

10:49.000 --> 10:50.000
Now,

10:50.000 --> 10:51.000
you will see one thing

10:51.000 --> 10:52.000
that as soon as I click

10:52.000 --> 10:53.000
on the submit button,

10:53.000 --> 10:54.000
as soon as I click

10:54.000 --> 10:55.000
on the submit button,

10:55.000 --> 10:56.000
what will happen

10:56.000 --> 10:57.000
that because of

10:57.000 --> 10:58.000
event dot

10:58.000 --> 10:59.000
prevent default,

10:59.000 --> 11:00.000
it will not load

11:00.000 --> 11:01.000
first.

11:01.000 --> 11:02.000
It will not reload,

11:02.000 --> 11:03.000
right?

11:03.000 --> 11:04.000
As you have seen

11:04.000 --> 11:05.000
that whenever you submit

11:05.000 --> 11:06.000
a form,

11:06.000 --> 11:07.000
the page reloads.

11:07.000 --> 11:08.000
But

11:08.000 --> 11:09.000
event dot

11:09.000 --> 11:10.000
prevent default

11:10.000 --> 11:11.000
will stop it from

11:11.000 --> 11:12.000
loading.

11:12.000 --> 11:13.000
Why will it

11:13.000 --> 11:14.000
come?

11:14.000 --> 11:15.000
I told you

11:15.000 --> 11:16.000
because

11:16.000 --> 11:17.000
if you see here,

11:17.000 --> 11:18.000
because

11:18.000 --> 11:19.000
here

11:19.000 --> 11:20.000
we have set

11:20.000 --> 11:21.000
something like this.

11:21.000 --> 11:22.000
Set is

11:22.000 --> 11:23.000
be loading.

11:23.000 --> 11:24.000
What have we set this be loading?

11:24.000 --> 11:25.000
Prove.

11:25.000 --> 11:26.000
When true is set,

11:26.000 --> 11:27.000
loading will be written.

11:27.000 --> 11:28.000
So,

11:28.000 --> 11:29.000
as soon as the handle is submitted,

11:29.000 --> 11:30.000
be loading is set to true.

11:30.000 --> 11:31.000
So,

11:31.000 --> 11:32.000
it will always be set to true

11:32.000 --> 11:33.000
after clicking submit.

11:33.000 --> 11:34.000
Okay,

11:34.000 --> 11:35.000
then we go back

11:35.000 --> 11:36.000
and

11:36.000 --> 11:37.000
here

11:37.000 --> 11:38.000
put

11:38.000 --> 11:39.000
everything

11:39.000 --> 11:40.000
and finally

11:40.000 --> 11:41.000
we will open the console

11:41.000 --> 11:42.000
and see after this.

11:42.000 --> 11:43.000
So,

11:43.000 --> 11:44.000
here we make the console

11:44.000 --> 11:45.000
a little smaller

11:45.000 --> 11:46.000
and now

11:46.000 --> 11:47.000
let's go here and click on submit.

11:47.000 --> 11:48.000
As soon as we click on submit,

11:48.000 --> 11:49.000
loading is written here

11:49.000 --> 11:50.000
and

11:50.000 --> 11:51.000
whatever

11:51.000 --> 11:52.000
data we have here

11:52.000 --> 11:53.000
is basically

11:53.000 --> 11:54.000
coming here

11:54.000 --> 11:55.000
and right now

11:55.000 --> 11:56.000
the p form data

11:56.000 --> 11:57.000
is coming here empty.

11:57.000 --> 11:58.000
Why is it coming empty?

11:58.000 --> 11:59.000
Let's check it quickly

11:59.000 --> 12:00.000
and

12:00.000 --> 12:01.000
here

12:01.000 --> 12:02.000
I

12:02.000 --> 12:03.000
go back

12:03.000 --> 12:04.000
and

12:04.000 --> 12:05.000
let's check

12:05.000 --> 12:06.000
why the data is empty

12:06.000 --> 12:07.000
here

12:07.000 --> 12:08.000
is showing.

12:08.000 --> 12:09.000
So,

12:09.000 --> 12:10.000
let's go back

12:10.000 --> 12:11.000
and

12:11.000 --> 12:12.000
click on submit.

12:12.000 --> 12:13.000
Okay,

12:13.000 --> 12:14.000
now

12:14.000 --> 12:15.000
here

12:15.000 --> 12:16.000
you can see

12:16.000 --> 12:17.000
that here

12:17.000 --> 12:18.000
basically

12:18.000 --> 12:19.000
now the data has come here

12:19.000 --> 12:20.000
so,

12:20.000 --> 12:21.000
it takes a little time

12:21.000 --> 12:22.000
whatever data is coming

12:22.000 --> 12:23.000
it takes a little time

12:23.000 --> 12:24.000
so,

12:24.000 --> 12:25.000
as soon as we click here

12:25.000 --> 12:26.000
the data has come here

12:26.000 --> 12:27.000
and

12:27.000 --> 12:28.000
when I click one more time

12:28.000 --> 12:29.000
it has come again

12:29.000 --> 12:30.000
so,

12:30.000 --> 12:31.000
the data is coming here

12:31.000 --> 12:32.000
the whole data is coming

12:32.000 --> 12:33.000
that

12:33.000 --> 12:34.000
first name is coming

12:34.000 --> 12:35.000
last name is coming

12:35.000 --> 12:36.000
and

12:36.000 --> 12:37.000
we are getting

12:37.000 --> 12:38.000
everything here.

12:38.000 --> 12:39.000
Okay,

12:39.000 --> 12:40.000
this means

12:40.000 --> 12:41.000
we are getting data.

12:41.000 --> 12:42.000
Now,

12:42.000 --> 12:43.000
here if we

12:43.000 --> 12:44.000
don't use

12:44.000 --> 12:45.000
p form data

12:45.000 --> 12:46.000
then it will work

12:46.000 --> 12:47.000
because

12:47.000 --> 12:48.000
because

12:48.000 --> 12:49.000
if we remove

12:49.000 --> 12:50.000
p form data

12:50.000 --> 12:51.000
and directly

12:51.000 --> 12:52.000
use data

12:52.000 --> 12:53.000
console

12:53.000 --> 12:54.000
dot

12:54.000 --> 12:55.000
log

12:55.000 --> 12:56.000
data

12:56.000 --> 12:57.000
log

12:57.000 --> 12:58.000
data

12:58.000 --> 12:59.000
and

12:59.000 --> 13:00.000
now

13:00.000 --> 13:01.000
we

13:01.000 --> 13:02.000
go back

13:02.000 --> 13:03.000
okay,

13:03.000 --> 13:04.000
now

13:04.000 --> 13:05.000
we

13:05.000 --> 13:06.000
go

13:06.000 --> 13:07.000
back

13:07.000 --> 13:08.000
okay,

13:08.000 --> 13:09.000
now

13:09.000 --> 13:10.000
we go back

13:10.000 --> 13:11.000
and

13:11.000 --> 13:12.000
here is the loading set

13:12.000 --> 13:13.000
and as soon as I click it

13:13.000 --> 13:14.000
from the office

13:14.000 --> 13:15.000
on submit

13:15.000 --> 13:16.000
you will see that

13:16.000 --> 13:17.000
the whole data has come

13:17.000 --> 13:18.000
all the data

13:18.000 --> 13:19.000
that we have

13:19.000 --> 13:20.000
has come

13:20.000 --> 13:21.000
so,

13:21.000 --> 13:22.000
we don't need p form data

13:22.000 --> 13:23.000
finally

13:23.000 --> 13:24.000
I can say that

13:24.000 --> 13:25.000
we remove the state

13:25.000 --> 13:26.000
of p form data

13:26.000 --> 13:27.000
now

13:27.000 --> 13:28.000
okay

13:28.000 --> 13:29.000
now

13:29.000 --> 13:30.000
after this

13:30.000 --> 13:31.000
after this

13:31.000 --> 13:32.000
here

13:32.000 --> 13:33.000
this much

13:33.000 --> 13:34.000
we have done

13:34.000 --> 13:35.000
now

13:35.000 --> 13:36.000
we remove it

13:36.000 --> 13:37.000
now

13:37.000 --> 13:38.000
we need

13:38.000 --> 13:39.000
to create

13:39.000 --> 13:40.000
a document of sanity

13:40.000 --> 13:41.000
and to create

13:41.000 --> 13:42.000
a document of sanity

13:42.000 --> 13:43.000
we have seen

13:43.000 --> 13:44.000
how it works

13:44.000 --> 13:45.000
so

13:45.000 --> 13:46.000
for that

13:46.000 --> 13:47.000
you have to

13:47.000 --> 13:48.000
make a variable

13:48.000 --> 13:49.000
by doing a doc

13:49.000 --> 13:50.000
and we have to put

13:50.000 --> 13:51.000
some things in it

13:51.000 --> 13:52.000
so,

13:52.000 --> 13:53.000
we will create

13:53.000 --> 13:54.000
some document

13:54.000 --> 13:55.000
like this

13:55.000 --> 13:56.000
so,

13:56.000 --> 13:57.000
it will be created

13:57.000 --> 13:58.000
here

13:58.000 --> 13:59.000
down

13:59.000 --> 14:00.000
so,

14:00.000 --> 14:01.000
by doing a doc

14:01.000 --> 14:02.000
we made

14:02.000 --> 14:03.000
an object

14:03.000 --> 14:04.000
and in this object

14:04.000 --> 14:05.000
we put an id

14:05.000 --> 14:06.000
you know

14:06.000 --> 14:07.000
it is necessary

14:07.000 --> 14:08.000
to put an id

14:08.000 --> 14:09.000
so,

14:09.000 --> 14:10.000
we want to send

14:10.000 --> 14:11.000
data

14:11.000 --> 14:12.000
in the profile

14:12.000 --> 14:13.000
schema

14:13.000 --> 14:14.000
now

14:14.000 --> 14:15.000
you will think

14:15.000 --> 14:16.000
what is written

14:16.000 --> 14:17.000
in the id

14:17.000 --> 14:18.000
so,

14:18.000 --> 14:19.000
I will tell you

14:19.000 --> 14:20.000
what we have done

14:20.000 --> 14:21.000
here

14:21.000 --> 14:22.000
what we have put

14:22.000 --> 14:23.000
in the first name

14:23.000 --> 14:24.000
data dot

14:24.000 --> 14:25.000
first name

14:25.000 --> 14:26.000
in the data

14:26.000 --> 14:27.000
the first name

14:27.000 --> 14:28.000
key

14:28.000 --> 14:29.000
will go

14:29.000 --> 14:30.000
in the first name

14:30.000 --> 14:31.000
in the last name

14:31.000 --> 14:32.000
data dot

14:32.000 --> 14:33.000
last name

14:33.000 --> 14:34.000
will go

14:34.000 --> 14:35.000
so,

14:35.000 --> 14:36.000
we are putting

14:36.000 --> 14:37.000
values

14:37.000 --> 14:38.000
all these things

14:38.000 --> 14:39.000
in the sanity

14:39.000 --> 14:40.000
before that

14:40.000 --> 14:41.000
let me show you

14:41.000 --> 14:42.000
the schema

14:42.000 --> 14:43.000
so,

14:43.000 --> 14:44.000
our profile dot js

14:44.000 --> 14:45.000
this is our profile dot js

14:45.000 --> 14:46.000
and

14:46.000 --> 14:47.000
I will open it

14:47.000 --> 14:48.000
what are the fields

14:48.000 --> 14:49.000
in profile dot js

14:49.000 --> 14:50.000
user email

14:50.000 --> 14:51.000
first name

14:51.000 --> 14:52.000
last name

14:52.000 --> 14:53.000
profile pic

14:53.000 --> 14:54.000
about

14:54.000 --> 14:55.000
work experience

14:55.000 --> 14:56.000
skill 2

14:56.000 --> 14:57.000
skill 3

14:57.000 --> 14:58.000
skill 4

14:58.000 --> 14:59.000
and then

14:59.000 --> 15:00.000
role

15:00.000 --> 15:01.000
these things

15:01.000 --> 15:02.000
are in our

15:02.000 --> 15:03.000
profile schema

15:03.000 --> 15:04.000
and

15:04.000 --> 15:05.000
in main dot js

15:05.000 --> 15:06.000
we have set

15:06.000 --> 15:07.000
these things only

15:07.000 --> 15:08.000
in the data

15:08.000 --> 15:09.000
and in the data

15:09.000 --> 15:10.000
this key

15:10.000 --> 15:11.000
first name

15:11.000 --> 15:12.000
last name

15:12.000 --> 15:13.000
we have seen this

15:13.000 --> 15:14.000
by printing

15:14.000 --> 15:15.000
this is coming

15:15.000 --> 15:16.000
so,

15:16.000 --> 15:17.000
we have set

15:17.000 --> 15:18.000
these things

15:18.000 --> 15:19.000
and these things

15:19.000 --> 15:20.000
we have already

15:20.000 --> 15:21.000
defined

15:21.000 --> 15:22.000
in our profile dot js

15:22.000 --> 15:23.000
so,

15:23.000 --> 15:24.000
after that

15:24.000 --> 15:25.000
we come to

15:25.000 --> 15:26.000
our profile picture

15:26.000 --> 15:27.000
so,

15:27.000 --> 15:28.000
in profile picture

15:28.000 --> 15:29.000
we have put

15:29.000 --> 15:30.000
something like

15:30.000 --> 15:31.000
preview image

15:31.000 --> 15:32.000
dot length

15:32.000 --> 15:33.000
greater than 0

15:33.000 --> 15:34.000
so,

15:34.000 --> 15:35.000
we remove this

15:35.000 --> 15:36.000
we don't need to put

15:36.000 --> 15:37.000
preview image

15:37.000 --> 15:38.000
review image

15:38.000 --> 15:39.000
and comma

15:39.000 --> 15:40.000
see what we have done

15:40.000 --> 15:41.000
in profile picture

15:41.000 --> 15:42.000
and in user email

15:42.000 --> 15:43.000
I am telling you

15:43.000 --> 15:44.000
what we have done

15:44.000 --> 15:45.000
by objecting the user

15:45.000 --> 15:46.000
so,

15:46.000 --> 15:47.000
basically

15:47.000 --> 15:48.000
what happened

15:48.000 --> 15:49.000
that our

15:49.000 --> 15:50.000
profile picture

15:50.000 --> 15:51.000
is here

15:51.000 --> 15:52.000
where

15:52.000 --> 15:53.000
in preview

15:53.000 --> 15:54.000
we are picking

15:54.000 --> 15:55.000
this thing

15:55.000 --> 15:56.000
suppose

15:56.000 --> 15:57.000
the user

15:57.000 --> 15:58.000
chooses a file

15:58.000 --> 15:59.000
so,

15:59.000 --> 16:00.000
the data url

16:00.000 --> 16:01.000
of that file

16:01.000 --> 16:02.000
will be saved

16:02.000 --> 16:03.000
so,

16:03.000 --> 16:04.000
let me show

16:04.000 --> 16:05.000
data url

16:05.000 --> 16:06.000
so,

16:06.000 --> 16:07.000
I will

16:07.000 --> 16:08.000
roughly

16:08.000 --> 16:09.000
here

16:09.000 --> 16:10.000
somewhere

16:10.000 --> 16:11.000
I will print this

16:11.000 --> 16:12.000
if

16:12.000 --> 16:13.000
field

16:13.000 --> 16:14.000
or

16:14.000 --> 16:15.000
or

16:15.000 --> 16:16.000
or

16:16.000 --> 16:17.000
or

16:17.000 --> 16:18.000
or

16:18.000 --> 16:19.000
or

16:19.000 --> 16:20.000
or

16:20.000 --> 16:21.000
or

16:21.000 --> 16:22.000
or

16:22.000 --> 16:23.000
or

16:23.000 --> 16:24.000
or

16:24.000 --> 16:25.000
or

16:25.000 --> 16:26.000
or

16:26.000 --> 16:27.000
or

16:27.000 --> 16:28.000
or

16:28.000 --> 16:29.000
or

16:29.000 --> 16:30.000
or

16:30.000 --> 16:31.000
or

16:31.000 --> 16:32.000
or

16:32.000 --> 16:33.000
or

16:33.000 --> 16:34.000
or

16:34.000 --> 16:35.000
or

16:35.000 --> 16:36.000
or

16:36.000 --> 16:37.000
or

16:37.000 --> 16:38.080
or

16:38.080 --> 16:38.880
or

16:38.880 --> 16:39.500
or

16:39.500 --> 16:39.920
or

16:39.920 --> 16:40.500
or

16:40.500 --> 16:41.120
or

16:41.120 --> 16:41.800
ok

16:41.800 --> 16:42.040
now

16:42.040 --> 16:42.440
let's go

16:42.440 --> 16:43.120
into our

16:43.120 --> 16:44.000
web

16:44.000 --> 16:44.200
page

16:44.200 --> 16:44.740
let's clear

16:44.740 --> 16:45.080
console

16:45.080 --> 16:46.500
here

16:46.500 --> 16:47.940
basically

16:47.940 --> 16:49.060
I do

16:49.060 --> 16:50.000
not

16:50.000 --> 16:51.000
anything

16:51.000 --> 16:52.400
here

16:52.400 --> 16:54.000
I will

16:54.000 --> 16:55.500
like

16:55.500 --> 16:56.000
here

16:56.000 --> 16:57.680
I have

16:57.680 --> 16:58.500
ал

17:02.700 --> 17:03.000
last

17:03.000 --> 17:03.560
screen

17:03.560 --> 17:04.000
is shakes

17:04.000 --> 17:13.000
We will show the same thing here because we have to lock the console in the wrong place.

17:13.000 --> 17:15.000
One minute.

17:15.000 --> 17:19.000
Okay.

17:19.000 --> 17:21.000
Okay.

17:21.000 --> 17:27.000
And apart from this, we have to lock reader.result not previewImage.

17:27.000 --> 17:30.000
reader.result

17:30.000 --> 17:34.000
The same thing because reader.result is finally set in previewImage.

17:34.000 --> 17:38.000
So we directly log reader.result.

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
We go back.

17:40.000 --> 17:45.000
And after coming here, we choose another file.

17:45.000 --> 17:48.000
We went here and chose this.

17:48.000 --> 17:54.000
As soon as we choose, you will see how big this data URL is coming.

17:54.000 --> 17:56.000
This data is written here.

17:56.000 --> 17:59.000
And then this very big base64 encoded code is coming.

17:59.000 --> 18:00.000
Very big.

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
This is basically our URL.

18:02.000 --> 18:08.000
Which is finally created after uploading the file.

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
So this URL is basically stored.

18:10.000 --> 18:11.000
This URL.

18:11.000 --> 18:12.000
Such a big URL.

18:12.000 --> 18:14.000
Do you understand?

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
So let's assume.

18:16.000 --> 18:19.000
I was going to show you what happens basically.

18:19.000 --> 18:22.000
Our file is decoded and converted into URL.

18:22.000 --> 18:25.000
And this URL is finally saved.

18:25.000 --> 18:28.000
And this URL shows you the image.

18:28.000 --> 18:29.000
Okay.

18:29.000 --> 18:32.000
But I was showing you this because.

18:32.000 --> 18:35.000
Because the preview image we have set here.

18:35.000 --> 18:37.000
If let's assume.

18:37.000 --> 18:40.000
If someone puts a preview image user.

18:40.000 --> 18:41.000
Someone puts.

18:41.000 --> 18:44.000
So he will get that URL here.

18:44.000 --> 18:45.000
Data URL.

18:45.000 --> 18:48.000
But if the user does not choose any file.

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
So it is set here by default.

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
You will get this URL.

18:52.000 --> 18:53.000
Got it?

18:53.000 --> 18:56.000
So here that URL will basically be of the user.

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
So whenever in the user's portfolio.

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
We will show the profile picture.

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
And if he has put any profile picture.

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
Then the profile picture of the user will be seen.

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
Otherwise the image of the hacker will be seen.

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
After this.

19:08.000 --> 19:09.000
After this.

19:09.000 --> 19:11.000
Where do we come?

19:11.000 --> 19:13.000
Let's come back here.

19:13.000 --> 19:14.000
Where have we taken the user email?

19:14.000 --> 19:15.000
See.

19:15.000 --> 19:16.000
Now the user email.

19:16.000 --> 19:19.000
Now we know that in our local storage.

19:19.000 --> 19:21.000
User email is kept.

19:21.000 --> 19:23.000
That is verified.

19:23.000 --> 19:25.000
That means it has also been checked with sanity.

19:25.000 --> 19:27.000
We checked it using the use effect.

19:27.000 --> 19:28.000
See.

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
We checked it with sanity.

19:30.000 --> 19:33.000
So it means that the user email is verified.

19:33.000 --> 19:35.000
Now when the user email is verified.

19:35.000 --> 19:40.000
So we directly take the user email from the local storage.

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
Now why did we take the user email?

19:42.000 --> 19:43.000
Let's see this too.

19:43.000 --> 19:45.000
We took the user email because.

19:45.000 --> 19:48.000
When we will make the portfolio site tomorrow.

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
We will show the portfolio site of the user.

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
So it will be something like this.

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
I will show you how.

19:54.000 --> 19:55.000
This is the website.

19:55.000 --> 19:56.000
Okay.

19:56.000 --> 19:57.000
This is the website.

19:57.000 --> 19:58.000
See here in the URL bar.

19:58.000 --> 19:59.000
It is written localhost.

19:59.000 --> 20:02.000
As the user will go to slash techy recon.

20:02.000 --> 20:10.000
So here if a user named techy recon exists in our sanity.

20:10.000 --> 20:13.000
So its full data will show here.

20:13.000 --> 20:15.000
With the portfolio website.

20:15.000 --> 20:17.000
Now what is techy recon?

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
Techy recon is basically an email.

20:19.000 --> 20:21.000
The email from which I am logged in.

20:21.000 --> 20:23.000
That is the first part of the email.

20:23.000 --> 20:25.000
It is not written at the readgmail.com.

20:25.000 --> 20:27.000
So how will we match tomorrow.

20:27.000 --> 20:29.000
That any user of this name exists.

20:29.000 --> 20:32.000
If someone put techy recon in the URL.

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
So how will we check tomorrow.

20:34.000 --> 20:35.000
That the person named techy recon.

20:35.000 --> 20:37.000
Does he have any portfolio with us.

20:37.000 --> 20:39.000
We will check it like this.

20:39.000 --> 20:41.000
We have taken input today in the portfolio form.

20:41.000 --> 20:42.000
User email.

20:42.000 --> 20:44.000
So when we will check tomorrow.

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
So we will use it to check.

20:46.000 --> 20:51.000
That if the user email is in the profile named document.

20:51.000 --> 20:52.000
In the schema.

20:52.000 --> 20:53.000
Its first.

20:53.000 --> 20:58.000
The first words that come before the at the read.

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
The first words that come before the at the read.

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
If they match with the URL words.

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
Then show the portfolio in it.

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
This thing will be clear now.

21:06.000 --> 21:08.000
So we are taking this.

21:08.000 --> 21:10.000
Because we can match it later.

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
User email and URL email.

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
The name above the URL.

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
And we can show it the side of the portfolio.

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
So for now I will remove it.

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
And here.

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
Here we have.

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
Here we have.

21:24.000 --> 21:25.000
JSON dot parse object.

21:25.000 --> 21:26.000
User object dot email.

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
Now what is the user object.

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
User object is our.

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
Basically what.

21:32.000 --> 21:35.000
Our user object is our local storage.

21:35.000 --> 21:39.000
Now we define the user object once.

21:39.000 --> 21:42.000
So here near the main.

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
Here we have defined the user object.

21:44.000 --> 21:45.000
Ok.

21:45.000 --> 21:48.000
So we have taken the user info object.

21:48.000 --> 21:50.000
And defined it like a user object.

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
And we have taken the email from it.

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
Now we have everything.

21:54.000 --> 21:55.000
Here we know everything.

21:55.000 --> 21:56.000
What we have taken.

21:56.000 --> 21:57.000
What we have done.

21:57.000 --> 21:58.000
Type.

21:58.000 --> 21:59.000
We know the type.

21:59.000 --> 22:00.000
It will be saved in the profile name document.

22:00.000 --> 22:01.000
Now what is the ID.

22:01.000 --> 22:03.000
Now you must be thinking.

22:03.000 --> 22:05.000
Why are we not keeping all that in the ID.

22:05.000 --> 22:08.000
Which we had kept while making the user.

22:08.000 --> 22:09.000
All.

22:09.000 --> 22:10.000
Now see what is there.

22:10.000 --> 22:11.000
Of every document.

22:11.000 --> 22:12.000
Of every schema.

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
Like the user.

22:14.000 --> 22:17.000
User was a different schema.

22:17.000 --> 22:20.000
Profile is a different schema.

22:20.000 --> 22:21.000
Now.

22:21.000 --> 22:23.000
For both of them.

22:23.000 --> 22:25.000
We cannot use the same ID.

22:25.000 --> 22:27.000
Once we have used the ID in the user.

22:27.000 --> 22:28.000
All.

22:28.000 --> 22:29.000
We have used all as ID.

22:29.000 --> 22:32.000
Now we cannot use the same thing in the profile.

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
So we have to use something different here.

22:34.000 --> 22:35.000
So what have we done.

22:35.000 --> 22:38.000
We have made a function of string to ask.

22:38.000 --> 22:39.000
Now what it does.

22:39.000 --> 22:41.000
The email of the user.

22:41.000 --> 22:43.000
The email of the user.

22:43.000 --> 22:46.000
It converts it to ask.

22:46.000 --> 22:47.000
Where does the user take the email from.

22:47.000 --> 22:48.000
From the local storage.

22:48.000 --> 22:49.000
From the local storage.

22:49.000 --> 22:50.000
From the user object.

22:50.000 --> 22:51.000
From the user object.

22:51.000 --> 22:52.000
From the local storage.

22:52.000 --> 22:53.000
He takes the email.

22:53.000 --> 22:55.000
And here we have converted it to the object.

22:55.000 --> 22:56.000
Because in the local storage.

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
This object is stored in the form of a string.

22:58.000 --> 22:59.000
Okay.

22:59.000 --> 23:03.000
Now here the user email.

23:03.000 --> 23:04.000
Basically ours.

23:04.000 --> 23:05.000
In the local storage.

23:05.000 --> 23:07.000
It converts it to ask.

23:07.000 --> 23:08.000
And it gives it as an ID.

23:08.000 --> 23:09.000
Now what is this.

23:09.000 --> 23:10.000
I will tell you.

23:10.000 --> 23:13.000
What is ask?

23:13.000 --> 23:16.000
You will go to the browser.

23:16.000 --> 23:17.000
Search ask.

23:17.000 --> 23:19.000
Ask is the American Standard Quote.

23:19.000 --> 23:28.000
You will see.

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
For questions.

23:30.000 --> 23:37.000
You will take question after your其实 is answered.

23:37.000 --> 23:42.000
This is a variable to which we have to also translate.

23:42.000 --> 23:43.000
How will we translate this.

23:43.000 --> 23:44.000
We can also use such a,

23:44.000 --> 23:45.000
Sometimes it isToo much which we have applied.

23:45.000 --> 23:46.000
To make it simple.

23:46.000 --> 23:47.000
I have done it.

23:47.000 --> 23:48.000
And every request.

23:48.000 --> 24:08.000
Wait a minute, I think I can see the ACA table here, here one by one, like A, A has been given a value of 65

24:08.000 --> 24:16.000
When we type A in the computer, it by default takes 65 as a number and converts it into a number

24:16.000 --> 24:20.000
Similarly, when we type small, by default, the computer converts it into 97

24:20.000 --> 24:28.000
Because it is easier for the computer to convert the numerical to binary code than the letter

24:28.000 --> 24:37.000
So now just understand that all the letters written in your keyboard, a particular number has been assigned to it by default

24:37.000 --> 24:43.000
And when you type the same number, the same number reads the computer as a memory

24:43.000 --> 24:45.000
It doesn't read A, it reads 97

24:45.000 --> 24:46.000
It reads capital E

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
It doesn't read A, it reads 65

24:48.000 --> 24:57.000
Okay, so what we have done is that we have converted our code here

24:57.000 --> 25:07.000
We have converted the email of the user, one by one, like t-e-c-h-y-f-g-o-h-n-john-doe-at-the-reads-email.com

25:07.000 --> 25:11.000
So we have converted each and every string into ASCII

25:11.000 --> 25:13.000
Converted into ASCII, that is, into numbers

25:13.000 --> 25:15.000
And we have assigned the same numbers to the ID

25:15.000 --> 25:17.000
Now how will we convert it into ASCII?

25:17.000 --> 25:18.000
It is quite easy

25:18.000 --> 25:19.000
I will tell you

25:19.000 --> 25:21.000
We will go up

25:21.000 --> 25:26.000
And somewhere up here

25:26.000 --> 25:27.000
We will make a function

25:27.000 --> 25:29.000
The function is string to ASCII

25:29.000 --> 25:32.000
We will put a string as a parameter in it

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
Now we will assign an empty array

25:34.000 --> 25:37.000
By doing ASCII array, we will make an empty array

25:37.000 --> 25:44.000
And all the words, all the letters in the email

25:44.000 --> 25:47.000
In JavaScript, there is a function called character code

25:47.000 --> 25:50.000
There is a function called character code

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
Basically, there is a method

25:52.000 --> 25:54.000
By using this, we will give each letter in it

25:54.000 --> 25:57.000
And it will convert it into numerical value

25:57.000 --> 25:59.000
And finally, it will be appended in the array

25:59.000 --> 26:01.000
It will be pushed in the array

26:01.000 --> 26:04.000
And finally, we will join the whole array

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
And it will become a very big number

26:06.000 --> 26:07.000
Okay

26:07.000 --> 26:09.000
So now I will show you by printing it

26:09.000 --> 26:10.000
What is it? How is it?

26:10.000 --> 26:13.000
After this, whatever document we have here

26:13.000 --> 26:16.000
We have made it

26:16.000 --> 26:21.000
Now we will see the document once by doing console.log

26:27.000 --> 26:29.000
console.log document

26:29.000 --> 26:32.000
Now we will see the document by doing console.log

26:32.000 --> 26:35.000
We will go to our browser

26:35.000 --> 26:37.000
And after going to the browser

26:37.000 --> 26:39.000
Here I clear console.log

26:39.000 --> 26:41.000
Here I write hello

26:43.000 --> 26:46.000
Hello world

26:46.000 --> 26:52.000
Here I write anything

26:52.000 --> 26:57.000
logo

26:57.000 --> 26:59.000
hello world

26:59.000 --> 27:01.000
Hello world

27:01.000 --> 27:03.000
You have to put all the values ​​in here

27:03.000 --> 27:04.000
OK

27:04.000 --> 27:05.000
And as soon I submitted it

27:05.000 --> 27:08.000
Our doc here

27:08.000 --> 27:10.000
Which is an object by create

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
And here all the values ​​come in it

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
we don't have any profile picture here

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
so by default profile picture is going to this

27:16.000 --> 27:18.000
we have put something in about

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
that came

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
user email is this

27:22.000 --> 27:24.000
user email is from local storage

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
id is this

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
i told you that it will convert user email to number

27:28.000 --> 27:30.000
so it converted to number

27:30.000 --> 27:32.000
so it became a unique id

27:32.000 --> 27:34.000
so for everyone it will be a unique id

27:34.000 --> 27:36.000
and type profile

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
so it became one document

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
now we have to push this document in sanity

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
how we will do that

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
how we will do that

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
you can see this document

27:46.000 --> 27:48.000
i will show you one more time

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
here by default profile picture is set

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
and after that id and all things

27:52.000 --> 27:54.000
ok

27:54.000 --> 27:56.000
after that we go to

27:56.000 --> 27:58.000
code

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
and

28:00.000 --> 28:02.000
here we

28:02.000 --> 28:04.000
here we will use this method

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
here we will use this

28:08.000 --> 28:10.000
this

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
and dot create and replace

28:12.000 --> 28:14.000
i told you create and replace

28:14.000 --> 28:16.000
if document doesn't exist then it will create

28:16.000 --> 28:18.000
and if it will actually exist then it will replace

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
we have used it for this

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
if tomorrow if a user

28:22.000 --> 28:24.000
fill new things in portfolio form

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
then details of his portfolio

28:26.000 --> 28:28.000
will change

28:28.000 --> 28:30.000
and we did the same thing

28:30.000 --> 28:32.000
here we printed id id

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
and here we did one more thing

28:34.000 --> 28:36.000
set is visible to true

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
and button loading to false set

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
now what will happen

28:40.000 --> 28:42.000
when user will click in submit

28:42.000 --> 28:44.000
then

28:44.000 --> 28:46.000
till the time this document will be created

28:46.000 --> 28:48.000
till then button loading will be true

28:48.000 --> 28:50.000
means loading will be written

28:50.000 --> 28:52.000
and as soon as document will be created

28:52.000 --> 28:54.000
then button loading will be false set

28:54.000 --> 28:56.000
and submit will be written

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
ok

28:58.000 --> 29:00.000
after this set is visible to true

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
we have set is visible to true

29:02.000 --> 29:04.000
set is visible to true

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
why we have set it to true

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
and here i will tell you

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
what is the state

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
you will go down

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
and here

29:14.000 --> 29:16.000
at the very bottom

29:16.000 --> 29:18.000
one minute

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
at the very bottom here

29:20.000 --> 29:22.000
as soon as

29:22.000 --> 29:24.000
submit button is clicked

29:24.000 --> 29:26.000
as soon as

29:26.000 --> 29:28.000
submit button is clicked

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
then here our

29:30.000 --> 29:32.000
is visible is set to true

29:32.000 --> 29:34.000
now as soon as is visible is set to true

29:34.000 --> 29:36.000
then we have made this div

29:36.000 --> 29:38.000
this div

29:38.000 --> 29:40.000
this div basically

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
gives the user

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
the url of portfolio

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
gives the url of portfolio

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
now what is the url of portfolio

29:48.000 --> 29:50.000
i have told you

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
that localhost

29:52.000 --> 29:54.000
slash techydecon

29:54.000 --> 29:56.000
the first word of our email

29:56.000 --> 29:58.000
the first word of our email at the rate

29:58.000 --> 30:00.000
will be our url of portfolio

30:00.000 --> 30:02.000
so this is the only thing

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
as soon as we click in submit

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
then we have

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
whatever is our email in local storage

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
its first word means

30:10.000 --> 30:12.000
the first word of our email

30:12.000 --> 30:14.000
which is in the 0th index

30:14.000 --> 30:16.000
before the rate

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
that thing we get here

30:18.000 --> 30:20.000
as a url

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
and we present it in some way

30:22.000 --> 30:24.000
visit your portfolio

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
and as soon as someone clicks in this

30:26.000 --> 30:28.000
then he

30:28.000 --> 30:30.000
slash

30:30.000 --> 30:32.000
slash

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
and whatever is our email

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
the first word of our email goes in it

30:36.000 --> 30:38.000
now i am understanding

30:38.000 --> 30:40.000
so we save it for now

30:40.000 --> 30:42.000
after saving

30:42.000 --> 30:44.000
we go to our

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
we go to our web page

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
now let's see

30:48.000 --> 30:50.000
what we have done

30:52.000 --> 30:54.000
we come here

30:54.000 --> 30:56.000
we have all the details

30:56.000 --> 30:58.000
ok

30:58.000 --> 31:00.000
we click here

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
and see what happened

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
as soon as i clicked there

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
what happened

31:06.000 --> 31:08.000
we got the object

31:08.000 --> 31:10.000
after that

31:10.000 --> 31:12.000
document was created

31:12.000 --> 31:14.000
and here

31:14.000 --> 31:16.000
submit came from there

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
loading state was false set

31:18.000 --> 31:20.000
and this visit your portfolio

31:20.000 --> 31:22.000
which i was telling you

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
this thing came here

31:24.000 --> 31:26.000
as soon as you click in visit your portfolio

31:26.000 --> 31:28.000
then you will go to slash techy recon

31:28.000 --> 31:30.000
and what is techy recon

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
whatever is my email set in local storage

31:32.000 --> 31:34.000
this is it

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
this is the first word of my email

31:36.000 --> 31:38.000
understood

31:38.000 --> 31:40.000
so this will be the URL for any of these

31:40.000 --> 31:42.000
so we want

31:42.000 --> 31:44.000
the URL of our portfolio site

31:44.000 --> 31:46.000
will be like this for everyone

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
the first word of his email

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
will be the URL of his portfolio

31:50.000 --> 31:52.000
so now how will it be

31:52.000 --> 31:54.000
we will tell you in detail

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
before that let's go and see our

31:56.000 --> 31:58.000
sanity

31:58.000 --> 32:00.000
go to profile

32:00.000 --> 32:02.000
as soon as you go to profile

32:02.000 --> 32:04.000
you will get the data of techy recon

32:04.000 --> 32:06.000
and here everything

32:06.000 --> 32:08.000
everything is set here

32:08.000 --> 32:10.000
now we don't have to do anything

32:10.000 --> 32:12.000
now we just

32:12.000 --> 32:14.000
whatever our

32:14.000 --> 32:16.000
portfolio

32:16.000 --> 32:18.000
what we have done here

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
we have logged in

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
filled the form

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
now we have to start making the portfolio site
