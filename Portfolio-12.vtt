WEBVTT

00:06.000 --> 00:11.400
So now we will start making portfolio pages, so how will the portfolio pages look, I showed

00:11.400 --> 00:20.000
you one more time, but let's see one more time, so here, when we go here and see, then

00:20.000 --> 00:29.600
portfolio pages will look like this, as you can see here, this page, this is our first

00:29.600 --> 00:37.200
home page template, home page will look something like this, now we will see where we will use

00:37.200 --> 00:42.600
the input we have taken, we will see this thing, so first of all, we will use the image, user

00:42.600 --> 00:50.600
picture here, we will use the user's name here, we will use the role of the user here,

00:50.600 --> 00:57.600
after this, here is our home page, so we will make a home page, the second thing we will

00:57.600 --> 00:59.600
make will be our about page.

00:59.600 --> 01:04.600
In the about page, we will use the profile picture again, we will use the name, what

01:04.600 --> 01:09.600
will we use after the name, we will use about after the name, right, we will use the skill

01:09.600 --> 01:13.600
here, we will use the experience, then the skill will be CA, right, the experience will

01:13.600 --> 01:17.600
be CA, we will use this, right, after this, there will be a third page, it will be a contact

01:17.600 --> 01:22.600
page, where we will show the contact information user key, which is email, we will show it

01:22.600 --> 01:27.600
instead of contact, then we will have to make the header and footer, so we will make that

01:27.600 --> 01:28.600
too.

01:28.600 --> 01:29.600
Okay.

01:29.600 --> 01:36.600
So, we have to make this thing, after this, now how will this work, how will we make

01:36.600 --> 01:41.600
it, basically, now we are seeing that the URL of our website is of this type, now I will

01:41.600 --> 01:51.600
give you an example, like GitHub, GitHub, and here we have written something like, for example,

01:51.600 --> 01:58.600
Linux, we have done something like this, and when we go here, so now we will see here that

01:58.600 --> 02:05.600
we go to github.com slash storeworlds, right, as soon as you go to github.com slash storeworlds,

02:05.600 --> 02:10.600
then there is a user like this, there is a user named storeworld, and what you have to

02:10.600 --> 02:14.600
do to go to the GitHub page of that user, you have to write the name of the user in the

02:14.600 --> 02:20.600
URL of the website, for example, there may be a user by doing saga, whatever it means,

02:20.600 --> 02:27.600
I am putting a random word, but such a user is existing, if you can see, okay, so this

02:27.600 --> 02:34.600
is a user, so these users are existing, like one is here, night, and such users are

02:34.600 --> 02:41.600
existing, basically, right, so what is happening here, that the github.com slash, whatever the

02:41.600 --> 02:47.600
username is, we see the user's GitHub here, okay, we will apply this thing to our website

02:47.600 --> 02:53.600
too, now the name of our website, the name of the website, for example, is this, slash,

02:53.600 --> 02:56.600
you will write, name, any user's name, you will write, name of the user, you will write,

02:56.600 --> 03:00.600
the name of the user, and we will enter, then here we will see the user, if this name

03:00.600 --> 03:04.600
of the user exists, then it will be visible, otherwise, what will it be visible, 404, means

03:04.600 --> 03:10.600
user not found, such a page will come, okay, so now how to define these routes, let's see

03:10.600 --> 03:16.600
this properly once, so we will go back to our VS code, and here we have defined routes

03:16.600 --> 03:20.600
in app.js, do you know, when we go to the slash, we will see the main page rendered,

03:20.600 --> 03:25.600
we had made a form in the main page, right, then we put logic in it, that if any user

03:25.600 --> 03:29.600
is not logged in, then it will go to the login page, right, if it has been logged in,

03:29.600 --> 03:33.600
then it will be visible on the main page, and now all the logic that we had put, it is

03:33.600 --> 03:39.600
visible here, now after this, now what will we do, now we will make two or three more

03:39.600 --> 03:46.600
routes like this, right, so I keep replicating it from below, and after this, what is here,

03:46.600 --> 03:53.600
here now we will put the third thing, which will be slash id, I will explain to you what

03:53.600 --> 03:54.600
I want to do.

03:55.600 --> 04:09.600
here we will put colon id slash about, then here is the font pack, then here one more

04:09.600 --> 04:23.600
thing, star, here, now what I have done here, let's know this, apart from this, here we

04:23.600 --> 04:40.540
will add something to about component, and here so we

04:40.540 --> 04:43.000
have 2 about components here one, we have made we have w just content is that about.

04:43.000 --> 04:48.600
we have made we have made bolt component, here went our out component, and this thing

04:48.600 --> 04:49.600
is imported to them.

04:49.600 --> 04:50.600
Okay, the export is complete.

04:50.600 --> 04:51.600
Where did we make this?

04:51.600 --> 04:52.600
We have make it in the components.

04:52.600 --> 04:59.600
here about contact login ok so i am telling you that what i am doing here

04:59.600 --> 05:05.600
here i am doing contact

05:05.600 --> 05:07.600
contact

05:07.600 --> 05:11.600
here what i did i will tell you

05:11.600 --> 05:13.600
what happened here

05:13.600 --> 05:16.600
we saw that when forward slash user used to come

05:16.600 --> 05:17.600
so he used to see main page

05:17.600 --> 05:19.600
he used to see login

05:19.600 --> 05:21.600
now what is this slash id here

05:21.600 --> 05:23.600
we said

05:23.600 --> 05:26.600
after url anything will be written

05:26.600 --> 05:28.600
after slash

05:28.600 --> 05:30.600
leaving login

05:30.600 --> 05:31.600
leaving login

05:31.600 --> 05:33.600
anything will be written

05:33.600 --> 05:35.600
because login is already defined

05:35.600 --> 05:38.600
anything will be written so it will be treated as an id

05:38.600 --> 05:40.600
in this route

05:40.600 --> 05:42.600
whatever is written after slash

05:42.600 --> 05:43.600
leaving them

05:43.600 --> 05:46.600
whatever will be written will be treated as an id

05:46.600 --> 05:50.600
so tomorrow we can capture it as an id

05:50.600 --> 05:51.600
means

05:51.600 --> 05:54.600
there is a method called use params

05:54.600 --> 05:57.600
we will be able to capture it by using it

05:57.600 --> 05:59.600
what i am saying you will understand it well

05:59.600 --> 06:01.600
before that i will

06:01.600 --> 06:03.600
here for now

06:03.600 --> 06:06.600
by saying not found

06:06.600 --> 06:09.600
i will create a page

06:09.600 --> 06:11.600
ok

06:11.600 --> 06:14.600
and here in component another page will be created

06:14.600 --> 06:16.600
by saying not found

06:16.600 --> 06:18.600
not found

06:18.600 --> 06:19.600
dot

06:20.600 --> 06:21.600
dot

06:21.600 --> 06:22.600
dot

06:22.600 --> 06:23.600
dot

06:23.600 --> 06:26.600
dot

06:26.600 --> 06:27.600
dot

06:27.600 --> 06:28.600
dot

06:28.600 --> 06:29.600
dot

06:29.600 --> 06:30.600
dot

06:30.600 --> 06:31.600
dot

06:31.600 --> 06:32.600
dot

06:32.600 --> 06:33.600
dot

06:33.600 --> 06:34.600
dot

06:34.600 --> 06:35.600
dot

06:35.600 --> 06:36.600
dot

06:36.600 --> 06:37.600
dot

06:37.600 --> 06:38.600
dot

06:38.600 --> 06:39.600
dot

06:39.600 --> 06:40.600
dot

06:40.600 --> 06:41.600
dot

06:41.600 --> 06:42.600
and you can here

06:42.600 --> 06:43.600
how cool

06:43.600 --> 06:44.600
you can see

06:44.600 --> 06:45.600
that

06:45.600 --> 06:46.600
Box

06:49.600 --> 06:52.600
Contact is not found. So now we will write 404.

06:52.600 --> 06:55.600
404

06:55.600 --> 06:58.600
And one minute. Ok.

06:58.600 --> 07:01.600
These are some of our components. Now we call them.

07:01.600 --> 07:04.600
After login, as soon as it goes to slash id,

07:04.600 --> 07:07.600
this will basically be the end page. So we will have to make a component

07:07.600 --> 07:10.600
named home.

07:10.600 --> 07:13.600
I will tell you all this in a few minutes.

07:13.600 --> 07:16.600
Ok.

07:16.600 --> 07:19.600
Now let's see. First let's import them quickly.

07:19.600 --> 07:22.600
Let's import the component.

07:22.600 --> 07:25.600
Press control space and enter.

07:25.600 --> 07:28.600
Ok.

07:28.600 --> 07:31.600
What I did here, you will see. In our website,

07:31.600 --> 07:34.600
as soon as someone writes something after slash id,

07:34.600 --> 07:37.600
which is not in routes, he will treat it as an id

07:37.600 --> 07:40.600
and it will go to the home page.

07:40.600 --> 07:43.600
In route, if slash id or any name

07:43.600 --> 07:46.600
or anything is seen and after that slash about is written

07:46.600 --> 07:49.600
then it will go to the about page.

07:49.600 --> 07:52.600
In id, by doing any id, if you put contact then it will go to

07:52.600 --> 07:55.600
slash contact. Otherwise, if from these

07:55.600 --> 07:58.600
if the user will try to write anything other than this

07:58.600 --> 08:01.600
then it will go to the not found page.

08:01.600 --> 08:04.600
Now I will explain it well. So here I go

08:04.600 --> 08:07.600
and here in my url

08:07.600 --> 08:10.600
slash any id

08:10.600 --> 08:13.600
if I will write anything here then it will be treated as an id.

08:13.600 --> 08:16.600
I can give it a number, name, anything.

08:16.600 --> 08:19.600
So this will be treated as an id.

08:19.600 --> 08:22.600
As soon as I press enter, I will come to the home page.

08:22.600 --> 08:25.600
Ok. As soon as I press enter, I have come to the home page.

08:25.600 --> 08:28.600
And let me see once what I have written on the home page.

08:28.600 --> 08:31.600
Which is

08:31.600 --> 08:34.600
Here I hit enter and go to the home page once.

08:34.600 --> 08:37.600
And here I write home.

08:37.600 --> 08:40.600
Ok. So I wrote any random id and hit enter

08:40.600 --> 08:43.600
so I came to the home page.

08:43.600 --> 08:46.600
Now after this id, I write slash about home page.

08:46.600 --> 08:49.600
So I will come to the about page.

08:49.600 --> 08:52.600
I write it as slash contact.

08:52.600 --> 08:55.600
So I will come to the contact page.

08:55.600 --> 08:58.600
Here basically this thing is this id which if you have not written

08:58.600 --> 09:01.600
and if you have tried to write something else other than that

09:01.600 --> 09:04.600
then which page will you come to?

09:04.600 --> 09:07.600
You have come to the home page for example.

09:07.600 --> 09:10.600
Because you had put a slash.

09:10.600 --> 09:13.600
Apart from this, one more thing to check.

09:13.600 --> 09:15.600
Which is here slash start.

09:16.600 --> 09:21.600
Ok. I think here is some big key.

09:21.600 --> 09:24.600
About has been done. Contact has been done.

09:24.600 --> 09:26.600
Ok.

09:26.600 --> 09:30.600
Ok. Not found is also fine here. Everything is fine.

09:30.600 --> 09:32.600
So here is something like this for now.

09:32.600 --> 09:34.600
Now after this

09:34.600 --> 09:36.600
I go to the browser.

09:36.600 --> 09:38.600
And here I write something like this.

09:38.600 --> 09:40.600
I write something like this which does not actually exist.

09:40.600 --> 09:44.600
Like this. This is a path which does not exist.

09:44.600 --> 09:47.600
Means actually this will be treated as an id.

09:47.600 --> 09:50.600
After this if you will write anything here which does not exist.

09:50.600 --> 09:53.600
If you will type enter then it will take you to 404 page.

09:53.600 --> 09:56.600
Because nothing like this does not exist.

09:56.600 --> 09:58.600
Isn't it?

09:58.600 --> 10:00.600
So what happened here?

10:00.600 --> 10:02.600
What happened here is that when you wrote slash

10:02.600 --> 10:04.600
then it will take you to the main page i.e. the form page.

10:04.600 --> 10:07.600
If you will write login then it will go to the login page.

10:07.600 --> 10:10.600
But as soon as you will write some parameter after that

10:10.600 --> 10:13.600
then it will treat this id and will take you to the home page.

10:14.600 --> 10:16.600
And after that if you will write about

10:16.600 --> 10:18.600
then it will take you to the about page and will take you to the contact page.

10:18.600 --> 10:20.600
But apart from about and contact

10:20.600 --> 10:22.600
if you have written something like this by doing slash

10:22.600 --> 10:26.600
then also it will take you to the not found page.

10:26.600 --> 10:28.600
It will take you to the not found page.

10:28.600 --> 10:30.600
Here we will do one more thing.

10:30.600 --> 10:32.600
Here if we will write slash

10:32.600 --> 10:34.600
if we will write normal

10:34.600 --> 10:36.600
then we will go to the form page.

10:36.600 --> 10:39.600
If we will write login then we will come to the login page.

10:39.600 --> 10:41.600
Isn't it?

10:41.600 --> 10:43.600
Now we will write slash any id.

10:43.600 --> 10:45.600
if we write techy.conversion

10:45.600 --> 10:46.600
then we will come to the home page.

10:46.600 --> 10:48.600
We will write slash

10:48.600 --> 10:50.600
if we will write home

10:50.600 --> 10:51.600
what will we get then?

10:51.600 --> 10:52.600
We will get the error.

10:52.600 --> 10:55.600
We will write slash contact

10:55.600 --> 10:57.600
then we will come to the contact page.

10:57.600 --> 10:59.600
About is in about page

10:59.600 --> 11:01.600
And if we will try to write something else

11:01.600 --> 11:03.600
what will we get then?

11:03.600 --> 11:04.600
Error.

11:04.600 --> 11:05.600
Alright

11:05.600 --> 11:09.600
If we will write contact then we will come to the contact page

11:10.600 --> 11:11.600
We did this.

11:11.600 --> 11:13.600
And basically here we have

11:13.600 --> 11:20.100
This id works here that you can capture this thing in any page in the name of id

11:20.100 --> 11:25.600
And then tomorrow you can compare this with our gmail id given in sanity

11:25.600 --> 11:29.600
By which we will know whether this user name exists or not

11:29.600 --> 11:33.600
Now what we do is that we go back

11:33.600 --> 11:39.600
And one more thing to pay attention to is that if we go to the slash

11:39.600 --> 11:43.600
So here we are logged in, that's why we see this page

11:43.600 --> 11:46.600
If we log out then we try to go to the slash

11:46.600 --> 11:49.600
Then we will not see this page, we will come to the login

11:49.600 --> 11:53.600
But if we go to the slash id, then we will see this page

11:53.600 --> 11:56.600
And we want this, if we want we can make it secure too

11:56.600 --> 11:59.600
But why didn't we make it because it is a portfolio page

11:59.600 --> 12:01.600
Whether you log in or not in github

12:01.600 --> 12:04.600
If you go to anyone's profile then you will see

12:04.600 --> 12:08.600
Because we want the user to see the portfolio

12:08.600 --> 12:09.600
We log in

12:09.600 --> 12:12.600
We want the user to log in when he makes an account

12:12.600 --> 12:15.600
Now he is not making an account, he just came to see someone else's portfolio

12:15.600 --> 12:16.600
So he can see

12:16.600 --> 12:17.600
Right

12:17.600 --> 12:18.600
These things

12:18.600 --> 12:21.600
So now again we log in

12:21.600 --> 12:23.600
Okay

12:23.600 --> 12:25.600
Now after this

12:25.600 --> 12:27.600
Now we go back

12:30.600 --> 12:32.600
Now here we have done these things

12:32.600 --> 12:34.600
Now I will show you what the actual work of id is

12:34.600 --> 12:35.600
What is the actual work of id

12:35.600 --> 12:36.600
We went to the home page

12:36.600 --> 12:38.600
In home.jsx

12:38.600 --> 12:39.600
Do one thing here

12:39.600 --> 12:40.600
Write

12:40.600 --> 12:44.600
const

12:44.600 --> 12:46.600
Bracket id

12:46.600 --> 12:49.600
Equals to use params

12:49.600 --> 12:51.600
Write this thing and enter

12:51.600 --> 12:54.600
Use params will be imported from react.com

12:54.600 --> 12:55.600
And now you

12:55.600 --> 12:57.600
Lock the console.

12:57.600 --> 12:59.600
Id

12:59.600 --> 13:04.600
What we did here

13:04.600 --> 13:06.600
A method named use params

13:06.600 --> 13:08.600
A function is in react

13:08.600 --> 13:10.600
What it does

13:10.600 --> 13:14.600
That whatever the parameter named id will get in the url

13:14.600 --> 13:16.600
It will fetch

13:16.600 --> 13:18.600
Now here we have made the parameter named id

13:18.600 --> 13:19.600
Here is the id

13:19.600 --> 13:20.600
So in the url

13:20.600 --> 13:21.600
After forward slash

13:21.600 --> 13:22.600
Whatever will happen

13:22.600 --> 13:24.600
Leaving the login

13:24.600 --> 13:27.600
That thing will treat you as an id

13:27.600 --> 13:28.600
And that thing

13:28.600 --> 13:31.600
That thing you will get by printing here

13:31.600 --> 13:32.600
Okay

13:32.600 --> 13:34.600
You can give some other names instead of id here

13:34.600 --> 13:35.600
For example, you give here

13:35.600 --> 13:36.600
Name

13:36.600 --> 13:37.600
If you give it slash name

13:37.600 --> 13:38.600
Here

13:38.600 --> 13:39.600
Slash name

13:39.600 --> 13:40.600
Slash name

13:40.600 --> 13:41.600
By doing slash name

13:41.600 --> 13:42.600
And then you here

13:42.600 --> 13:43.600
Instead of id

13:43.600 --> 13:44.600
By doing slash name

13:44.600 --> 13:45.600
If you say

13:45.600 --> 13:47.600
So you get that parameter

13:47.600 --> 13:50.600
Which parameter you have given the name of slash name

13:50.600 --> 13:51.600
Okay

13:51.600 --> 13:52.600
So for now we leave it as id

13:52.600 --> 13:53.600
Right

13:53.600 --> 13:55.600
Leave it as id for now

13:55.600 --> 13:57.600
And here

13:57.600 --> 13:58.600
We left the id

13:58.600 --> 14:00.600
Now after this we will reload it

14:00.600 --> 14:02.600
And we will go back

14:02.600 --> 14:04.600
And here we

14:04.600 --> 14:05.600
Here we

14:05.600 --> 14:06.600
Forward slash

14:06.600 --> 14:07.600
Forward slash

14:07.600 --> 14:08.600
Now

14:08.600 --> 14:09.600
Let's call our console

14:09.600 --> 14:10.600
And here

14:10.600 --> 14:11.600
I write forward slash

14:11.600 --> 14:12.600
Anything

14:12.600 --> 14:13.600
Forward slash

14:13.600 --> 14:14.600
Write

14:14.600 --> 14:15.600
Std

14:15.600 --> 14:16.600
Colon

14:16.600 --> 14:17.600
Colon

14:17.600 --> 14:18.600
Out

14:18.600 --> 14:19.600
And enter

14:19.600 --> 14:20.600
So see this

14:20.600 --> 14:21.600
Std out

14:21.600 --> 14:22.600
Std out

14:22.600 --> 14:24.600
Printed in the console

14:24.600 --> 14:25.600
After this

14:25.600 --> 14:26.600
If I slash

14:26.600 --> 14:27.600
Write anything

14:27.600 --> 14:28.600
And write

14:28.600 --> 14:29.600
Or I write about

14:29.600 --> 14:30.600
So

14:30.600 --> 14:32.600
You will not get anything here

14:32.600 --> 14:33.600
Because here

14:33.600 --> 14:34.600
We have come to the about page

14:34.600 --> 14:35.600
And we

14:35.600 --> 14:36.600
Where did the id grab

14:36.600 --> 14:37.600
In the home page

14:37.600 --> 14:38.600
But if you go to the home page

14:38.600 --> 14:39.600
Then you will see the id

14:39.600 --> 14:40.600
It will be printed

14:40.600 --> 14:41.600
I mean you understand

14:41.600 --> 14:43.600
It will print the id parameter

14:43.600 --> 14:44.600
That is

14:44.600 --> 14:45.600
This parameter

14:45.600 --> 14:46.600
For this

14:46.600 --> 14:47.600
It has become an id

14:47.600 --> 14:49.600
So you can use it anywhere

14:49.600 --> 14:50.600
Now

14:50.600 --> 14:51.600
Where will you use it

14:51.600 --> 14:52.600
You will find out later

14:52.600 --> 14:53.600
Okay

14:53.600 --> 14:54.600
After this

14:54.600 --> 14:55.600
We will go to the office

14:55.600 --> 14:56.600
So here

14:56.600 --> 14:57.600
We have come

14:57.600 --> 14:58.600
In the code of our home page

14:58.600 --> 14:59.600
And here

14:59.600 --> 15:00.600
What we will do

15:00.600 --> 15:01.600
That is

15:01.600 --> 15:03.600
We will verify

15:03.600 --> 15:04.600
The url key id

15:04.600 --> 15:05.600
In the url

15:05.600 --> 15:06.600
Basically

15:06.600 --> 15:07.600
The id

15:07.600 --> 15:08.600
We will compare it

15:08.600 --> 15:09.600
First of all

15:09.600 --> 15:10.600
In our sanity

15:10.600 --> 15:12.600
The profile document

15:12.600 --> 15:13.600
Inside it

15:13.600 --> 15:14.600
With the email id

15:14.600 --> 15:15.600
That is

15:15.600 --> 15:17.600
Our url key id

15:17.600 --> 15:18.600
If any

15:18.600 --> 15:19.600
Profile document

15:19.600 --> 15:20.600
Matches

15:20.600 --> 15:21.600
Any

15:21.600 --> 15:22.600
For example

15:22.600 --> 15:23.600
Profile document

15:23.600 --> 15:24.600
And its email id

15:24.600 --> 15:25.600
Matches

15:25.600 --> 15:26.600
Our

15:26.600 --> 15:27.600
url key id

15:27.600 --> 15:28.600
This means

15:28.600 --> 15:29.600
The data of the user

15:29.600 --> 15:30.600
Exists

15:30.600 --> 15:31.600
And if the data of the user

15:31.600 --> 15:32.600
Exists

15:32.600 --> 15:33.600
Then we

15:33.600 --> 15:34.600
Can show it

15:34.600 --> 15:35.600
In the url

15:35.600 --> 15:36.600
But if that id

15:36.600 --> 15:37.600
Does not match

15:37.600 --> 15:38.600
With any profile document

15:38.600 --> 15:39.600
Of sanity

15:39.600 --> 15:40.600
This means

15:40.600 --> 15:41.600
That the user

15:41.600 --> 15:42.600
Does not exist

15:42.600 --> 15:43.600
That

15:43.600 --> 15:44.600
Useless

15:44.600 --> 15:45.600
Id

15:45.600 --> 15:46.600
Has been entered

15:46.600 --> 15:47.600
In the url

15:47.600 --> 15:48.600
So we will redirect it

15:48.600 --> 15:49.600
In 404

15:49.600 --> 15:50.600
How to do this

15:50.600 --> 15:51.600
For this

15:51.600 --> 15:52.600
What we will do

15:52.600 --> 15:53.600
First of all

15:53.600 --> 15:54.600
We will remove it

15:54.600 --> 15:55.600
By doing

15:55.600 --> 15:56.600
Console.log

15:56.600 --> 15:57.600
And here

15:57.600 --> 15:58.600
We will put

15:58.600 --> 15:59.600
A use effect

15:59.600 --> 16:00.600
We will put

16:00.600 --> 16:01.600
Use effect

16:01.600 --> 16:02.600
And it is

16:02.600 --> 16:03.600
Imported

16:03.600 --> 16:04.600
Now we will

16:04.600 --> 16:05.600
Use it

16:05.600 --> 16:06.600
And in this

16:06.600 --> 16:07.600
We will create

16:07.600 --> 16:08.600
A first

16:08.600 --> 16:09.600
Asynchronous function

16:09.600 --> 16:10.600
Which we will name

16:10.600 --> 16:11.600
FetchData

16:11.600 --> 16:12.600
And this

16:12.600 --> 16:13.600
Will be

16:13.600 --> 16:14.600
An asynchronous

16:14.600 --> 16:15.600
Function

16:15.600 --> 16:16.600
And after

16:16.600 --> 16:17.600
This

16:17.600 --> 16:18.600
Here

16:18.600 --> 16:19.600
We will

16:19.600 --> 16:20.600
Put a

16:20.600 --> 16:21.600
Try block

16:21.600 --> 16:22.600
And a

16:22.600 --> 16:23.600
Catch

16:23.600 --> 16:24.600
Try catch

16:24.600 --> 16:25.600
Ok

16:25.600 --> 16:26.600
Now

16:26.600 --> 16:27.600
The first

16:27.600 --> 16:28.600
Thing that

16:28.600 --> 16:29.600
Will go

16:29.600 --> 16:30.600
In this

16:30.600 --> 16:31.600
Will go

16:31.600 --> 16:32.600
Our

16:32.600 --> 16:33.600
Query

16:33.600 --> 16:34.600
Our Query

16:34.600 --> 16:35.600
Will go

16:35.600 --> 16:36.600
For whose

16:36.600 --> 16:37.600
Sanity

16:37.600 --> 16:38.600
So Query

16:38.600 --> 16:39.600
Will be

16:39.600 --> 16:40.600
Something like this

16:40.600 --> 16:41.600
Here is

16:41.600 --> 16:42.600
That Query

16:42.600 --> 16:43.600
What does

16:43.600 --> 16:44.600
Query say

16:44.600 --> 16:45.600
Let's see

16:45.600 --> 16:46.600
So

16:46.600 --> 16:47.600
Query says

16:47.600 --> 16:48.600
That

16:48.600 --> 16:49.600
The

16:49.600 --> 16:50.600
Res

16:50.600 --> 16:51.600
Name

16:51.600 --> 16:52.600
Variable

16:52.600 --> 16:53.600
Put that result

16:53.600 --> 16:54.600
In it

16:54.600 --> 16:55.600
Fetch

16:55.600 --> 16:56.600
Put that result

16:56.600 --> 16:57.600
And keep

16:57.600 --> 16:58.600
Where

16:58.600 --> 16:59.600
The type

16:59.600 --> 17:00.600
Of the

17:00.600 --> 17:01.600
Profile

17:01.600 --> 17:02.600
Of the

17:02.600 --> 17:03.600
Id

17:03.600 --> 17:04.600
Of the

17:04.600 --> 17:05.600
Id

17:05.600 --> 17:06.600
Is

17:06.600 --> 17:07.640
Which

17:07.640 --> 17:08.600
Is

17:08.600 --> 17:09.600
In

17:09.600 --> 17:10.600
The

17:10.600 --> 17:11.600
U

17:11.600 --> 17:12.600
R

17:12.600 --> 17:13.600
L

17:13.600 --> 17:14.600
Which

17:14.600 --> 17:15.600
Is

17:15.600 --> 17:16.600
Variable

17:16.600 --> 17:17.600
In

17:17.600 --> 17:18.600
The

17:18.600 --> 17:19.600
URL

17:19.600 --> 17:20.600
After

17:20.600 --> 17:21.600
Slash

17:21.600 --> 17:22.600
That

17:22.600 --> 17:23.600
Is

17:23.600 --> 17:24.600
Our

17:24.600 --> 17:25.600
Id

17:25.600 --> 17:26.600
If

17:26.600 --> 17:27.600
That

17:27.600 --> 17:28.600
Id

17:28.600 --> 17:29.600
That

17:29.600 --> 17:30.600
Is

17:30.600 --> 17:31.600
U

17:31.600 --> 17:33.600
we have added at the rate gmail.com

17:33.600 --> 17:34.600
what will it do?

17:34.600 --> 17:35.600
at the rate gmail.com

17:35.600 --> 17:37.600
it will convert it into an email id

17:37.600 --> 17:38.600
that id was half

17:38.600 --> 17:40.600
because we kept it half intentionally

17:40.600 --> 17:41.600
because it looks good

17:41.600 --> 17:45.600
but here we have appended at the rate gmail.com

17:45.600 --> 17:49.600
now we have just compared it with the user email in the profile

17:49.600 --> 17:52.600
if there is any user email in the profile

17:52.600 --> 17:54.600
which is equal to id

17:54.600 --> 17:56.600
which is equal to id

17:56.600 --> 17:58.600
then fetch its data to us

17:58.600 --> 17:59.600
so what will we do?

17:59.600 --> 18:01.600
we will add a condition after that

18:01.600 --> 18:05.600
that if res

18:05.600 --> 18:07.600
res means response

18:07.600 --> 18:09.600
if there is a response

18:09.600 --> 18:14.600
and the response length is greater than 0

18:14.600 --> 18:16.600
there is no empty response

18:16.600 --> 18:18.600
there is no empty response

18:18.600 --> 18:19.600
and there is a response

18:19.600 --> 18:21.600
and there is no empty response

18:21.600 --> 18:22.600
then what will we do?

18:22.600 --> 18:25.600
we will make a state at the top

18:25.600 --> 18:27.600
we will name the state

18:27.600 --> 18:28.600
user data

18:28.600 --> 18:29.600
user data

18:29.600 --> 18:30.600
and

18:30.600 --> 18:31.600
and

18:31.600 --> 18:34.600
here we will enter a set user data

18:34.600 --> 18:36.600
and this user data

18:36.600 --> 18:38.600
is of which type?

18:38.600 --> 18:40.600
will be an array

18:41.600 --> 18:42.600
use state

18:42.600 --> 18:46.600
and here we will enter it in the form of an array

18:46.600 --> 18:47.600
okay

18:47.600 --> 18:48.600
now whatever this data is

18:48.600 --> 18:50.600
we have to set it in this

18:50.600 --> 18:52.600
if the response is an object

18:52.600 --> 18:53.600
then

18:53.600 --> 18:54.600
what will we do?

18:54.600 --> 18:55.600
set user data

18:55.600 --> 18:57.600
and we will enter the response in this

18:57.600 --> 18:58.600
okay

18:58.600 --> 19:08.600
As soon as this happens, we will make another block in the else block.

19:08.600 --> 19:11.600
If the response is not there, then what to do?

19:11.600 --> 19:16.600
If the response is not there, it means that he did not get any data of that email.

19:16.600 --> 19:22.600
If anyone is putting anything in the URL, instead of ID, anything, A, B, C, D, X, Y, anything.

19:22.600 --> 19:28.600
And the ID in that type of URL, that type of email did not exist in Sanity.

19:28.600 --> 19:29.600
What does this mean?

19:29.600 --> 19:31.600
User does not exist.

19:31.600 --> 19:34.600
And if the user does not exist, then what do we have to do?

19:34.600 --> 19:35.600
We have to redirect the user.

19:35.600 --> 19:37.600
We do not have any portfolio of that name.

19:37.600 --> 19:38.600
So we will navigate the user.

19:38.600 --> 19:40.600
Where will we navigate?

19:40.600 --> 19:45.600
We will navigate the user to any page that shows 404.

19:45.600 --> 19:47.600
And when did we see 404?

19:47.600 --> 19:50.600
Whenever we used to go to such a place,

19:50.600 --> 19:52.600
we used to go to such a path that did not exist.

19:52.600 --> 19:54.600
It used to give 404 on its own.

19:54.600 --> 19:56.600
I will show you one thing.

19:56.600 --> 20:02.600
Whenever we used to try to go somewhere else other than these, it used to give 404.

20:02.600 --> 20:03.600
So we will do the same thing.

20:03.600 --> 20:06.600
Before that, we will have to set up this navigate.

20:06.600 --> 20:08.600
So we will set up the navigate.

20:08.600 --> 20:09.600
How will we do that?

20:09.600 --> 20:10.600
Come here.

20:10.600 --> 20:15.600
const navigate is equal to use navigate.

20:15.600 --> 20:17.600
And here the import is done on its own.

20:17.600 --> 20:18.600
And we have set up.

20:18.600 --> 20:21.600
After this, here we will use navigate.

20:21.600 --> 20:23.600
Navigate.

20:23.600 --> 20:25.600
And where will we navigate it?

20:25.600 --> 20:29.600
no slash user found.

20:29.600 --> 20:32.600
We have written this URL on its own.

20:32.600 --> 20:33.600
This URL does not exist.

20:33.600 --> 20:35.600
Now when this URL does not exist,

20:35.600 --> 20:38.600
it will redirect it to 404 on its own.

20:38.600 --> 20:40.600
It will show 404 component.

20:40.600 --> 20:42.600
Okay.

20:42.600 --> 20:43.600
Now here one more thing.

20:43.600 --> 20:45.600
If we get any error,

20:45.600 --> 20:49.600
if we get any error in the catch error,

20:49.600 --> 20:50.600
then what will happen?

20:50.600 --> 20:51.600
Then what will happen?

20:51.600 --> 20:53.600
Still, this user will put it in not found.

20:53.600 --> 20:56.600
If there is any error, where will we go?

20:56.600 --> 20:58.600
In no user found.

20:58.600 --> 21:00.600
Now let's check it once.

21:00.600 --> 21:02.600
And if it works,

21:02.600 --> 21:04.600
then it means we are good to go.

21:04.600 --> 21:05.600
Apart from this,

21:05.600 --> 21:07.600
the function of fetch data,

21:07.600 --> 21:09.600
we have not called it.

21:09.600 --> 21:10.600
It is necessary to call it.

21:10.600 --> 21:13.600
So let's call it just below.

21:13.600 --> 21:14.600
Here,

21:14.600 --> 21:17.600
let's call it just after it is made.

21:17.600 --> 21:18.600
And now what do we do?

21:18.600 --> 21:20.600
Let's go to our web page.

21:20.600 --> 21:22.600
And when you go to the web page,

21:22.600 --> 21:24.600
then you go to the site.

21:24.600 --> 21:26.600
As soon as we go to the site,

21:26.600 --> 21:27.600
we,

21:27.600 --> 21:28.600
you,

21:28.600 --> 21:29.600
here,

21:29.600 --> 21:30.600
what we have done is,

21:30.600 --> 21:31.600
we have implemented it only on the home page.

21:31.600 --> 21:33.600
So that thing will only work on the home page.

21:33.600 --> 21:35.600
So if we go here,

21:35.600 --> 21:36.600
any such thing,

21:36.600 --> 21:38.600
like techy recon.

21:38.600 --> 21:40.600
I go to techy recon and enter.

21:40.600 --> 21:42.600
So here it says,

21:42.600 --> 21:43.600
no user found.

21:43.600 --> 21:44.600
Why did this happen?

21:44.600 --> 21:45.600
Let's see it once.

21:45.600 --> 21:48.600
techy slash recon.

21:48.600 --> 21:49.600
And as soon as we go to this,

21:49.600 --> 21:50.600
we navigate.

21:50.600 --> 21:51.600
Why?

21:51.600 --> 21:52.600
Let's see it once.

21:52.600 --> 21:53.600
So we go to the profile

21:53.600 --> 21:56.600
and here the user named techy recon is closed.

21:56.600 --> 21:59.600
Already in the profile.

21:59.600 --> 22:00.600
But why is it not happening here?

22:00.600 --> 22:04.600
Let's see it once.

22:04.600 --> 22:05.600
Okay.

22:05.600 --> 22:06.600
Slash,

22:06.600 --> 22:07.600
if I try to go here,

22:07.600 --> 22:08.600
try to go,

22:08.600 --> 22:09.600
hello world,

22:09.600 --> 22:10.600
if I go somewhere else like this,

22:10.600 --> 22:11.600
then I will go.

22:11.600 --> 22:12.600
So here,

22:12.600 --> 22:13.600
no user found is redirecting.

22:13.600 --> 22:16.600
But if I go to techy recon,

22:16.600 --> 22:18.600
which is an existing user,

22:18.600 --> 22:20.600
forward slash,

22:20.600 --> 22:21.600
enter,

22:21.600 --> 22:22.600
then no user found is still coming.

22:22.600 --> 22:24.600
We have to see what is the problem with this.

22:24.600 --> 22:26.600
Let's check it quickly.

22:26.600 --> 22:28.600
So the problem is that

22:28.600 --> 22:30.600
our client file is basically,

22:30.600 --> 22:31.600
we have not imported it.

22:31.600 --> 22:32.600
We have used the client,

22:32.600 --> 22:33.600
client dot fetch,

22:33.600 --> 22:34.600
but we forgot to import it.

22:34.600 --> 22:35.600
So we have to remember this.

22:35.600 --> 22:37.600
So we press control and space

22:37.600 --> 22:39.600
and import it.

22:39.600 --> 22:41.600
So I think

22:41.600 --> 22:43.600
this import will be done.

22:43.600 --> 22:45.600
Why is this not being imported?

22:45.600 --> 22:46.600
I have to see it.

22:46.600 --> 22:47.600
Write client directly here.

22:47.600 --> 22:49.600
If you write your client directly,

22:49.600 --> 22:51.600
then it will be imported.

22:51.600 --> 22:52.600
But here,

22:52.600 --> 22:53.600
one minute,

22:53.600 --> 22:55.600
I will have to select JSX first from here.

22:55.600 --> 22:57.600
So how did I select this?

22:57.600 --> 22:58.600
Right below,

22:58.600 --> 22:59.600
what I show you,

22:59.600 --> 23:00.600
the screen,

23:00.600 --> 23:01.600
by doing something,

23:01.600 --> 23:03.600
you will see here,

23:03.600 --> 23:04.600
this,

23:04.600 --> 23:06.600
which you will see at the very bottom,

23:06.600 --> 23:08.600
JSX is written in the bottom right corner.

23:08.600 --> 23:09.600
You will click on it.

23:09.600 --> 23:10.600
And when,

23:10.600 --> 23:12.600
if something else was written there instead of JSX,

23:12.600 --> 23:14.600
then you will select it by doing JSX.

23:14.600 --> 23:15.600
Okay?

23:15.600 --> 23:16.600
Okay.

23:17.600 --> 23:18.600
Now here,

23:18.600 --> 23:19.600
what we do is,

23:19.600 --> 23:20.600
the client,

23:20.600 --> 23:21.600
we will write the client,

23:21.600 --> 23:22.600
if we press enter,

23:22.600 --> 23:23.600
then the client will be imported.

23:23.600 --> 23:24.600
And after this,

23:24.600 --> 23:27.600
now let's go and check our webpage.

23:27.600 --> 23:29.600
Now we have come to our webpage.

23:29.600 --> 23:30.600
And here,

23:30.600 --> 23:32.600
once I write techy recon,

23:32.600 --> 23:33.600
techy recon.

23:33.600 --> 23:34.600
So you will see,

23:34.600 --> 23:36.600
now we have come to the home page.

23:36.600 --> 23:37.600
Here,

23:37.600 --> 23:38.600
you understood,

23:38.600 --> 23:39.600
when we wrote an ID here,

23:39.600 --> 23:40.600
which is valid,

23:40.600 --> 23:41.600
basically,

23:41.600 --> 23:42.600
by doing techy recon,

23:42.600 --> 23:44.600
the email we have,

23:44.600 --> 23:45.600
it exists.

23:45.600 --> 23:46.600
Now here,

23:46.600 --> 23:47.600
we have not shown the entire email.

23:47.600 --> 23:48.600
Once you keep in mind,

23:48.600 --> 23:49.600
we have only written techy recon.

23:49.600 --> 23:51.600
But what is going on in the background,

23:51.600 --> 23:52.600
we are reading it as an email.

23:52.600 --> 23:53.600
I will show you.

23:53.600 --> 23:55.600
We see in the background here.

23:55.600 --> 23:56.600
We have here,

23:56.600 --> 23:57.600
what was the ID,

23:57.600 --> 23:58.600
techy recon.

23:58.600 --> 23:59.600
But who are we matching with?

23:59.600 --> 24:01.600
techy recon plus at the rate gmail dot com.

24:01.600 --> 24:03.600
So it is matching with one user email,

24:03.600 --> 24:05.600
which exists in the profile.

24:05.600 --> 24:06.600
Okay.

24:06.600 --> 24:07.600
So because of this,

24:07.600 --> 24:09.600
we are showing the home page there.

24:09.600 --> 24:10.600
But,

24:10.600 --> 24:11.600
but,

24:11.600 --> 24:13.600
if we write something here instead of techy recon,

24:13.600 --> 24:14.600
which does not exist,

24:14.600 --> 24:15.600
then,

24:15.600 --> 24:16.600
right?

24:16.600 --> 24:17.600
So if we write here,

24:17.600 --> 24:18.600
abcd,

24:18.600 --> 24:19.600
which,

24:19.600 --> 24:20.600
abcd at the rate gmail dot com,

24:20.600 --> 24:22.600
no user name exists.

24:22.600 --> 24:23.600
If we type enter,

24:23.600 --> 24:25.600
then we will come here in no user font.

24:25.600 --> 24:26.600
See,

24:26.600 --> 24:27.600
it has been redirected.

24:27.600 --> 24:28.600
It has been redirected.

24:28.600 --> 24:29.600
Now,

24:29.600 --> 24:30.600
if we had written something else,

24:30.600 --> 24:31.600
for example,

24:31.600 --> 24:32.600
xyz,

24:32.600 --> 24:33.600
then also,

24:33.600 --> 24:34.600
we would not be coming here.

24:34.600 --> 24:35.600
But yes,

24:35.600 --> 24:36.600
in techy recon,

24:36.600 --> 24:38.600
we are able to do that thing.

24:38.600 --> 24:40.600
We are able to do that thing for techy recon.

24:40.600 --> 24:41.600
Now,

24:41.600 --> 24:42.600
when we go to techy recon,

24:42.600 --> 24:43.600
then we will not get any error.

24:43.600 --> 24:44.600
But,

24:44.600 --> 24:45.600
apart from this,

24:45.600 --> 24:46.600
if we had done abcd,

24:46.600 --> 24:48.600
if we had written abcd slash about,

24:48.600 --> 24:50.600
then we would have been able to go to about page.

24:50.600 --> 24:51.600
Because,

24:51.600 --> 24:52.600
we have not put any check in about page.

24:52.600 --> 24:53.600
Like,

24:53.600 --> 24:54.600
we have put a check in home page.

24:54.600 --> 24:56.600
We have to put the same type of check in about page also.

24:56.600 --> 24:57.600
Right?

24:57.600 --> 24:58.600
And,

24:58.600 --> 24:59.600
similarly,

24:59.600 --> 25:00.600
we have to put in contact also.

25:00.600 --> 25:01.600
So,

25:01.600 --> 25:02.600
for now,

25:02.600 --> 25:03.600
we will do that thing also.

25:03.600 --> 25:04.600
So,

25:04.600 --> 25:05.600
we come back.

25:05.600 --> 25:06.600
And,

25:06.600 --> 25:07.600
our user data here,

25:07.600 --> 25:09.600
we had set that in our state.

25:09.600 --> 25:11.600
The state of user data which we have made.

25:11.600 --> 25:12.600
Here,

25:12.600 --> 25:13.600
we have set the user data.

25:13.600 --> 25:14.600
And,

25:14.600 --> 25:16.600
the response which we had received,

25:16.600 --> 25:17.600
basically,

25:17.600 --> 25:18.600
that is our main data.

25:18.600 --> 25:19.600
And,

25:19.600 --> 25:20.600
we have set the same response.

25:20.600 --> 25:21.600
Now,

25:21.600 --> 25:22.600
we are also printing that response.

25:22.600 --> 25:23.600
So,

25:23.600 --> 25:24.600
let's see how the response is written.

25:24.600 --> 25:25.600
Now,

25:25.600 --> 25:26.600
we will go to techy recon.

25:26.600 --> 25:29.600
I will open this.

25:29.600 --> 25:30.600
And,

25:30.600 --> 25:31.600
see this.

25:31.600 --> 25:32.600
Here,

25:32.600 --> 25:33.600
the array has come.

25:33.600 --> 25:34.600
As soon as you go to the array,

25:34.600 --> 25:35.600
see this.

25:35.600 --> 25:36.600
In the zeroth file,

25:36.600 --> 25:37.600
you have got all the details.

25:37.600 --> 25:38.600
Have you written techy recon?

25:38.600 --> 25:39.600
Have you written techy recon?

25:39.600 --> 25:40.600
And,

25:40.600 --> 25:41.600
here,

25:41.600 --> 25:42.600
all the details have come.

25:42.600 --> 25:43.600
Of the user.

25:43.600 --> 25:44.600
Where,

25:44.600 --> 25:45.600
right?

25:45.600 --> 25:46.600
Hi there,

25:46.600 --> 25:47.600
first name,

25:47.600 --> 25:48.600
last name,

25:48.600 --> 25:49.600
profile picture,

25:49.600 --> 25:50.600
all the details,

25:50.600 --> 25:51.600
associated with this email,

25:51.600 --> 25:52.600
all have come to us.

25:52.600 --> 25:53.600
Now,

25:53.600 --> 25:54.600
we can use them,

25:54.600 --> 25:55.600
to show,

25:55.600 --> 25:56.600
to showcase on our page.

25:56.600 --> 25:57.600
Because,

25:57.600 --> 25:58.600
now,

25:58.600 --> 25:59.600
we have got everything.

25:59.600 --> 26:00.600
So,

26:00.600 --> 26:01.600
let's go.

26:01.600 --> 26:02.600
And,

26:02.600 --> 26:03.600
let's start making the design of the main page.

26:03.600 --> 26:04.600
Okay.

26:04.600 --> 26:05.600
So,

26:05.600 --> 26:06.600
what will we do here?

26:06.600 --> 26:07.600
First of all,

26:07.600 --> 26:08.600
I will remove this.

26:08.600 --> 26:09.600
And,

26:09.600 --> 26:10.600
after this,

26:10.600 --> 26:11.600
the first thing we will do is,

26:11.600 --> 26:12.600
we will make,

26:12.600 --> 26:13.600
header and,

26:13.600 --> 26:14.600
footer.

26:14.600 --> 26:15.600
Okay.

26:15.600 --> 26:16.600
So,

26:16.600 --> 26:17.600
we will go to components.

26:17.600 --> 26:18.600
Okay.

26:18.600 --> 26:19.600
What did I press?

26:19.600 --> 26:20.600
Okay.

26:20.600 --> 26:21.600
Okay.

26:21.600 --> 26:22.600
So,

26:22.600 --> 26:23.600
we will go to our,

26:23.600 --> 26:24.600
main source.

26:24.600 --> 26:25.600
And,

26:25.600 --> 26:26.600
we will go to components.

26:26.600 --> 26:27.600
And,

26:27.600 --> 26:28.600
we will make a new component.

26:28.600 --> 26:29.600
We will name it,

26:29.600 --> 26:30.600
header dot,

26:30.600 --> 26:31.600
jsx.

26:31.600 --> 26:32.600
Okay.

26:32.600 --> 26:33.600
And,

26:33.600 --> 26:34.600
after this,

26:34.600 --> 26:35.600
we will write,

26:35.600 --> 26:36.600
r,

26:36.600 --> 26:37.600
a,

26:37.600 --> 26:38.600
f,

26:38.600 --> 26:39.600
c,

26:39.600 --> 26:40.600
and,

26:40.600 --> 26:41.600
we will write.

26:41.600 --> 26:42.600
Then,

26:42.600 --> 26:43.600
we will write,

26:43.600 --> 26:44.600
footer dot,

26:44.600 --> 26:45.600
jsx.

26:45.600 --> 26:46.600
footer dot,

26:46.600 --> 26:47.600
jsx.

26:47.600 --> 26:48.600
Now,

26:48.600 --> 26:50.600
header and footer are very small.

26:50.600 --> 26:51.600
So,

26:51.600 --> 26:52.600
you will get its code in,

26:52.600 --> 26:53.600
code section.

26:53.600 --> 26:54.600
So,

26:54.600 --> 26:55.600
you copy paste it directly.

26:55.600 --> 26:56.600
And,

26:56.600 --> 26:57.600
here,

26:57.600 --> 26:58.600
what we did is,

26:58.600 --> 26:59.600
let's understand.

26:59.600 --> 27:00.600
There is nothing in header and footer.

27:00.600 --> 27:01.600
Basically,

27:01.600 --> 27:02.600
we have captured the id here,

27:02.600 --> 27:03.600
using use params.

27:03.600 --> 27:04.600
And,

27:04.600 --> 27:05.600
here,

27:05.600 --> 27:06.600
we have used link.

27:06.600 --> 27:07.600
What is link?

27:07.600 --> 27:08.600
We understand this.

27:08.600 --> 27:09.600
You remember,

27:09.600 --> 27:10.600
we used routes in app dot jsx.

27:10.600 --> 27:11.600
Okay.

27:11.600 --> 27:12.600
Routes.

27:12.600 --> 27:13.600
Now,

27:13.600 --> 27:14.600
the routes,

27:14.600 --> 27:15.600
we use these routes,

27:15.600 --> 27:17.600
to decide the path.

27:17.600 --> 27:18.600
And,

27:18.600 --> 27:19.600
here,

27:19.600 --> 27:20.600
we have used link in header.

27:20.600 --> 27:21.600
This link,

27:21.600 --> 27:22.600
takes you to the same path,

27:22.600 --> 27:24.600
which is decided in our routes.

27:24.600 --> 27:25.600
But,

27:25.600 --> 27:27.600
without reloading the page.

27:27.600 --> 27:28.600
Means,

27:28.600 --> 27:29.600
here,

27:29.600 --> 27:30.600
in link,

27:30.600 --> 27:31.600
as we have put,

27:31.600 --> 27:32.600
id slash,

27:32.600 --> 27:33.600
forward slash.

27:33.600 --> 27:34.600
This means,

27:34.600 --> 27:35.600
we are talking about home page.

27:35.600 --> 27:36.600
Id,

27:36.600 --> 27:37.600
suppose,

27:37.600 --> 27:38.600
someone from techy recon,

27:38.600 --> 27:39.600
localhost slash techy recon slash.

27:39.600 --> 27:40.600
Means,

27:40.600 --> 27:41.600
as soon as you click in this,

27:41.600 --> 27:42.600
it will go to home.

27:42.600 --> 27:43.600
Then,

27:43.600 --> 27:44.600
this id,

27:44.600 --> 27:45.600
will go to techy recon slash contact.

27:45.600 --> 27:46.600
techy recon slash about.

27:46.600 --> 27:47.600
So,

27:47.600 --> 27:48.600
here,

27:48.600 --> 27:49.600
we have written id.

27:49.600 --> 27:50.600
And,

27:50.600 --> 27:51.600
here,

27:51.600 --> 27:52.600
using use params,

27:52.600 --> 27:53.600
we have taken the id.

27:53.600 --> 27:54.600
And,

27:54.600 --> 27:55.600
in link tag,

27:55.600 --> 27:56.600
we use some steps.

27:56.600 --> 27:57.600
We put 2.

27:57.600 --> 27:58.600
And,

27:58.600 --> 27:59.600
after that,

27:59.600 --> 28:00.600
we write in it,

28:00.600 --> 28:01.600
whatever the url is.

28:01.600 --> 28:02.600
Basically.

28:02.600 --> 28:03.600
And,

28:03.600 --> 28:04.600
here,

28:04.600 --> 28:05.600
we have put the profile picture.

28:05.600 --> 28:06.600
Here it is.

28:06.600 --> 28:07.600
We have put the image.

28:07.600 --> 28:08.600
Basically,

28:08.600 --> 28:09.600
its,

28:09.600 --> 28:10.600
here it is.

28:10.600 --> 28:11.600
So,

28:11.600 --> 28:12.600
let me show you once,

28:12.600 --> 28:13.600
how it is shown.

28:15.600 --> 28:16.600
So,

28:16.600 --> 28:17.600
we will come here.

28:17.600 --> 28:18.600
And,

28:18.600 --> 28:19.600
before that,

28:19.600 --> 28:20.600
we have to import the header once.

28:20.600 --> 28:21.600
So,

28:21.600 --> 28:22.600
we will go to home.

28:22.600 --> 28:23.600
We will go to home.

28:23.600 --> 28:24.600
And,

28:24.600 --> 28:25.600
here,

28:25.600 --> 28:26.600
first,

28:26.600 --> 28:27.600
we will import the header.

28:27.600 --> 28:28.600
Header.

28:28.600 --> 28:29.600
Ok.

28:29.600 --> 28:30.600
So,

28:30.600 --> 28:31.600
we have imported the header.

28:31.600 --> 28:32.600
After that,

28:32.600 --> 28:33.600
we will,

28:33.600 --> 28:34.600
in return,

28:34.600 --> 28:35.600
here,

28:35.600 --> 28:36.600
first of all,

28:36.600 --> 28:37.600
we will put,

28:37.600 --> 28:38.600
a header.

28:38.600 --> 28:39.600
So,

28:39.600 --> 28:40.600
we will put,

28:40.600 --> 28:41.600
header.

28:41.600 --> 28:42.600
And,

28:42.600 --> 28:43.600
after that,

28:43.600 --> 28:44.600
this is basically,

28:44.600 --> 28:45.600
a component.

28:45.600 --> 28:46.600
So,

28:46.600 --> 28:47.600
all this,

28:47.600 --> 28:48.600
is fine.

28:48.600 --> 28:49.600
Now,

28:49.600 --> 28:50.600
we go to our page.

28:50.600 --> 28:51.600
And,

28:51.600 --> 28:52.600
now,

28:52.600 --> 28:53.600
you will see,

28:53.600 --> 28:54.600
you can see the header.

28:54.600 --> 28:55.600
You can see the header.

28:55.600 --> 28:56.600
So,

28:56.600 --> 28:57.600
this header,

28:57.600 --> 28:58.600
is of this type.

28:58.600 --> 28:59.600
Now,

28:59.600 --> 29:00.600
as you click on home,

29:00.600 --> 29:01.600
where will you go?

29:01.600 --> 29:02.600
You will use the link tag.

29:02.600 --> 29:03.600
And,

29:03.600 --> 29:04.600
where will you go?

29:04.600 --> 29:05.600
In the tag icon,

29:05.600 --> 29:06.600
in the forward slash.

29:06.600 --> 29:07.600
So,

29:07.600 --> 29:08.600
you will be on this page.

29:08.600 --> 29:09.600
We used the tag icon,

29:09.600 --> 29:10.600
that is why.

29:10.600 --> 29:11.600
And,

29:11.600 --> 29:12.600
if you click on contact,

29:12.600 --> 29:13.600
you will go to the tag icon slash,

29:13.600 --> 29:14.600
contact.

29:14.600 --> 29:15.600
Okay?

29:15.600 --> 29:16.600
And,

29:16.600 --> 29:17.600
if you click on about,

29:17.600 --> 29:18.600
you will go to

29:18.600 --> 29:19.600
tag icon slash,

29:19.600 --> 29:20.600
about.

29:20.600 --> 29:21.600
Same thing,

29:21.600 --> 29:22.600
if this id,

29:22.600 --> 29:23.600
was something else,

29:23.600 --> 29:24.600
for example,

29:24.600 --> 29:25.600
was by hitting,

29:25.600 --> 29:26.600
which doesn't exist,

29:26.600 --> 29:27.600
then,

29:27.600 --> 29:28.600
you will directly come to this page.

29:28.600 --> 29:29.600
But,

29:29.600 --> 29:30.600
if the id exists,

29:30.600 --> 29:31.600
then,

29:31.600 --> 29:32.600
you will see this page,

29:32.600 --> 29:33.600
and you will also see the header footer.

29:33.600 --> 29:34.600
Okay?

29:34.600 --> 29:35.600
You must have understood,

29:35.600 --> 29:36.600
what we have done here,

29:36.600 --> 29:37.600
basically.

29:37.600 --> 29:38.600
Now,

29:38.600 --> 29:39.600
you can't go directly to

29:39.600 --> 29:40.600
slash home.

29:40.600 --> 29:41.600
If you had put it there,

29:41.600 --> 29:42.600
directly slash home.

29:42.600 --> 29:43.600
What is slash home?

29:43.600 --> 29:44.600
It doesn't exist, right?

29:44.600 --> 29:45.600
But,

29:45.600 --> 29:46.600
if you had put id slash home,

29:46.600 --> 29:47.600
sorry,

29:47.600 --> 29:48.600
if you had put id slash about,

29:48.600 --> 29:49.600
then,

29:49.600 --> 29:50.600
it would have existed.

29:50.600 --> 29:51.600
If you had put id and

29:51.600 --> 29:52.600
directly slash about,

29:52.600 --> 29:53.600
then,

29:53.600 --> 29:54.600
it wouldn't have existed.

29:54.600 --> 29:55.600
It doesn't exist.

29:55.600 --> 29:56.600
So,

29:56.600 --> 29:57.600
the header we have,

29:57.600 --> 29:58.600
that is why,

29:58.600 --> 29:59.600
we have shown it today.

29:59.600 --> 30:00.600
Now,

30:00.600 --> 30:01.600
after this,

30:01.600 --> 30:02.600
our header is done.

30:02.600 --> 30:03.600
Now,

30:03.600 --> 30:04.600
we will go back.

30:04.600 --> 30:05.600
And,

30:05.600 --> 30:06.600
after this,

30:06.600 --> 30:07.600
our other thing,

30:07.600 --> 30:09.600
its code is also given to you.

30:09.600 --> 30:10.600
So,

30:10.600 --> 30:11.600
now,

30:11.600 --> 30:12.600
if you put it directly here,

30:12.600 --> 30:13.600
then,

30:13.600 --> 30:14.600
there is nothing in it.

30:14.600 --> 30:15.600
So,

30:15.600 --> 30:16.600
our header and footer are made.

30:16.600 --> 30:17.600
And,

30:17.600 --> 30:18.600
after this,

30:18.600 --> 30:19.600
we come back to our home.

30:19.600 --> 30:20.600
After coming to home,

30:20.600 --> 30:21.600
here,

30:21.600 --> 30:22.600
our main logic,

30:22.600 --> 30:23.600
we have made it.

30:23.600 --> 30:24.600
After this,

30:24.600 --> 30:25.600
the main thing that comes,

30:25.600 --> 30:26.600
that is something,

30:26.600 --> 30:27.600
whatever your style is,

30:27.600 --> 30:28.600
whatever your elements are,

30:28.600 --> 30:29.600
basically.

30:29.600 --> 30:30.600
So,

30:30.600 --> 30:31.600
its code is also given to you,

30:31.600 --> 30:32.600
that,

30:32.600 --> 30:33.600
whatever style it is,

30:33.600 --> 30:34.600
and whatever our page looks like,

30:34.600 --> 30:35.600
that,

30:35.600 --> 30:36.600
that,

30:36.600 --> 30:38.600
those are only styles.

30:38.600 --> 30:39.600
So,

30:39.600 --> 30:40.600
styles,

30:40.600 --> 30:41.600
basically,

30:41.600 --> 30:42.600
if you understand,

30:42.600 --> 30:43.600
I will explain it to you,

30:43.600 --> 30:44.600
the work that is being done here.

30:44.600 --> 30:45.600
And,

30:45.600 --> 30:46.600
that is an easy thing,

30:46.600 --> 30:47.600
making styles.

30:47.600 --> 30:48.600
Just,

30:48.600 --> 30:49.600
the main thing that was left,

30:49.600 --> 30:50.600
that was,

30:50.600 --> 30:51.600
how to get data from Sanity.

30:51.600 --> 30:52.600
And,

30:52.600 --> 30:53.600
how to compare the top URL ID,

30:53.600 --> 30:54.600
and,

30:54.600 --> 30:55.600
how to know,

30:55.600 --> 30:56.600
that how the user exists.

30:56.600 --> 30:57.600
And,

30:57.600 --> 30:58.600
if the user exists,

30:58.600 --> 30:59.600
then,

30:59.600 --> 31:00.600
we have to show the data of that.

31:00.600 --> 31:01.600
So,

31:01.600 --> 31:02.600
we did it here.

31:02.600 --> 31:03.600
What we did,

31:03.600 --> 31:04.600
see this.

31:04.600 --> 31:05.600
Whatever the design is,

31:05.600 --> 31:14.600
Now we have created a header and we have started making styles under it.

31:14.600 --> 31:19.600
First thing is image. So the image of the user will be visible in the first page.

31:19.600 --> 31:22.600
How will the image be visible? It will be visible from here.

31:22.600 --> 31:26.600
UserData.length 0. What is userData? It is our state.

31:26.600 --> 31:31.600
If it exists, its length is greater than 0, it means there is some data in userData.

31:31.600 --> 31:39.600
And if there is data, then the element with the 0th index in the array,

31:39.600 --> 31:45.600
i.e. the first element that I showed you, bring the profile picture that exists in it.

31:45.600 --> 31:52.600
And if there is no profile picture, then directly put this thing here.

31:52.600 --> 31:56.600
What is it? tiniurl.com and instead of this, we put our source here.

31:56.600 --> 32:00.600
Which source? The image we have put in assets.

32:00.600 --> 32:01.600
Which source? The image we have put in assets.

32:01.600 --> 32:04.600
And the initial image? profile.jpg. We put this.

32:04.600 --> 32:10.600
If no profile picture exists, then it will show directly profile.jpg.

32:10.600 --> 32:20.600
components slash assets slash profile dot jpg. So this is it.

32:20.600 --> 32:23.600
So you know where we got this profile picture from?

32:23.600 --> 32:26.600
This is the user data set we had set here.

32:26.600 --> 32:28.600
And we got the profile picture from this user data.

32:28.600 --> 32:30.600
If it exists, then we will show the profile data.

32:30.600 --> 32:35.600
Otherwise, we will show the profile.jpg directly.

32:35.600 --> 32:39.600
Apart from this, we will keep the first name and last name of the user here.

32:39.600 --> 32:42.600
So what we will do here is, we used the h1 tag.

32:42.600 --> 32:44.600
We used the h1 tag here.

32:44.600 --> 32:47.600
And if the first name exists in the user data,

32:47.600 --> 32:50.600
till the time the data is being loaded, for example, till the time there is no data,

32:50.600 --> 32:52.600
it will write loading there.

32:52.600 --> 32:55.600
Till the time there is no data, it will write loading there.

32:55.600 --> 32:59.600
And as soon as the data is there, if it comes,

32:59.600 --> 33:01.600
then we will write first name plus last name.

33:01.600 --> 33:03.600
That is, its name will be shown.

33:03.600 --> 33:07.600
Now we have to set the loading here too.

33:07.600 --> 33:09.600
We have used loading here.

33:09.600 --> 33:12.600
We have used the loading state, but where will we define it?

33:12.600 --> 33:14.600
Let's define it here.

33:14.600 --> 33:21.600
const loading and set loading.

33:21.600 --> 33:25.600
By default, we set the true.

33:25.600 --> 33:27.600
By default, the loading will remain true.

33:29.600 --> 33:31.600
And when will we set it false?

33:31.600 --> 33:34.600
That is, when the data comes to the user in the beginning,

33:34.600 --> 33:36.600
then the page will be loading for it.

33:36.600 --> 33:38.600
Because nothing has been fetched yet.

33:38.600 --> 33:41.600
And as soon as it is fetched, we will set loading false.

33:41.600 --> 33:45.600
Loading will be set false and the data will be shown to the user.

33:45.600 --> 33:47.600
Loading is also done here.

33:47.600 --> 33:52.600
Here we have shown the user's first name plus last name here.

33:52.600 --> 33:54.600
After this, the user's role will come here.

33:54.600 --> 33:56.600
The user will put his role here.

33:56.600 --> 33:58.600
After this, we have made a card here.

33:58.600 --> 34:00.600
We have shown you the card.

34:00.600 --> 34:03.600
And after this, we have put a button below.

34:03.600 --> 34:05.600
Sorry, inside the card.

34:05.600 --> 34:08.600
Basically, the card is attached to the link tag.

34:08.600 --> 34:09.600
There are two cards in it.

34:09.600 --> 34:12.600
By doing contact me and about me.

34:12.600 --> 34:15.600
As soon as you press the contact me card, you will go to contact.

34:15.600 --> 34:16.600
ID slash contact.

34:16.600 --> 34:18.600
We are redirecting the user in this way.

34:18.600 --> 34:20.600
Because we need our ID.

34:20.600 --> 34:22.600
To put the user in the contact or about page.

34:22.600 --> 34:24.600
All its things are here.

34:24.600 --> 34:27.600
And basically, everything else is normal.

34:27.600 --> 34:29.600
Let's go to our web page.

34:29.600 --> 34:32.600
And let's see if there is any error.

34:32.600 --> 34:33.600
Ok.

34:33.600 --> 34:34.600
So, link not defined.

34:34.600 --> 34:35.600
Ok.

34:35.600 --> 34:36.600
Fine.

34:36.600 --> 34:38.600
So, we basically have to import the link.

34:38.600 --> 34:40.600
So, we will go back.

34:40.600 --> 34:42.600
And here is our link.

34:42.600 --> 34:44.600
We will select it.

34:44.600 --> 34:45.600
Control space and hit enter.

34:45.600 --> 34:47.600
The link has been imported.

34:47.600 --> 34:50.600
In the header also, we have probably imported the link.

34:50.600 --> 34:51.600
Ok.

34:51.600 --> 34:52.600
Let's go back.

34:52.600 --> 34:54.600
There is still some error.

34:54.600 --> 34:56.600
And now the footer is not defined.

34:56.600 --> 34:58.600
So, we have to import the footer also.

34:58.600 --> 35:01.600
So, we basically import the footer.

35:01.600 --> 35:03.600
So, where will we go?

35:03.600 --> 35:05.600
Just below.

35:05.600 --> 35:07.600
And the footer which we have kept here.

35:07.600 --> 35:08.600
We will do this.

35:08.600 --> 35:09.600
Control space and hit enter.

35:09.600 --> 35:11.600
The footer has also been imported.

35:11.600 --> 35:13.600
And finally, you must be able to see.

35:13.600 --> 35:16.600
That we can see here.

35:16.600 --> 35:19.600
We can see our entire web page here.

35:19.600 --> 35:20.600
Right.

35:20.600 --> 35:21.600
Here the name of the user has come.

35:21.600 --> 35:22.600
Hello world.

35:22.600 --> 35:25.600
Because in our form, we had put the name hello world.

35:25.600 --> 35:27.600
We had put the role as web dev.

35:27.600 --> 35:28.600
Ok.

35:28.600 --> 35:30.600
If we press about me, contact me, then the link tag will be used.

35:30.600 --> 35:33.600
In the link, it will go to slash id slash about.

35:33.600 --> 35:35.600
It will go to slash id slash contact.

35:35.600 --> 35:36.600
Ok.

35:36.600 --> 35:37.600
Now, as soon as we click, see.

35:37.600 --> 35:38.600
We have come to the contact page.

35:38.600 --> 35:41.600
As soon as we click, we have come to the about page.

35:41.600 --> 35:42.600
Now, see here.

35:42.600 --> 35:43.600
Loading has come in the middle.

35:43.600 --> 35:44.600
What does loading tell?

35:44.600 --> 35:46.600
That the data is being loaded.

35:46.600 --> 35:48.600
Fetch is not done yet.

35:48.600 --> 35:49.600
Now, what do we do once?

35:49.600 --> 35:50.600
Press in portfolio builder.

35:50.600 --> 35:52.600
So, we will come to our form page.

35:52.600 --> 35:54.600
Now, here we choose the file.

35:54.600 --> 35:57.600
Now, we put our data here and see.

35:57.600 --> 35:59.600
We went here in downloads.

35:59.600 --> 36:04.600
And we chose some image from here.

36:04.600 --> 36:06.600
For example, we chose this image.

36:06.600 --> 36:07.600
We put the name.

36:07.600 --> 36:12.600
Techie Recon.

36:12.600 --> 36:18.600
I am a professional.

36:18.600 --> 36:20.600
You are writing on your own.

36:20.600 --> 36:23.600
Web developer.

36:23.600 --> 36:24.600
Having.

36:24.600 --> 36:26.600
Knowledge.

36:26.600 --> 36:29.600
Or you can write deep knowledge kind of.

36:29.600 --> 36:31.600
Knowledge of.

36:31.600 --> 36:33.600
React.

36:33.600 --> 36:35.600
And monstack.

36:35.600 --> 36:37.600
And you directly write monstack.

36:37.600 --> 36:39.600
Do something like this.

36:39.600 --> 36:40.600
And blah blah.

36:40.600 --> 36:42.600
You can write whatever else you want to write.

36:42.600 --> 36:44.600
Here I was just doing testing.

36:44.600 --> 36:45.600
Experience.

36:45.600 --> 36:48.600
I have an experience.

36:48.600 --> 36:51.600
Of.

36:51.600 --> 36:53.600
10 years.

36:53.600 --> 36:55.600
Working with.

36:55.600 --> 36:58.600
Big MNCs.

36:58.600 --> 37:00.600
Okay.

37:00.600 --> 37:02.600
Now, you can write your role.

37:02.600 --> 37:04.600
For example, web developer.

37:04.600 --> 37:05.600
And you can write a pipe symbol.

37:05.600 --> 37:06.600
Network engineer.

37:06.600 --> 37:07.600
You can write a role like this.

37:07.600 --> 37:09.600
Then you can put any other skill.

37:09.600 --> 37:10.600
For example.

37:10.600 --> 37:11.600
Whatever is written here.

37:11.600 --> 37:13.600
I will replicate the same thing.

37:13.600 --> 37:14.600
Team lead.

37:14.600 --> 37:15.600
Okay.

37:15.600 --> 37:17.600
And after this.

37:17.600 --> 37:18.600
You can put anyone.

37:18.600 --> 37:20.600
Project.

37:20.600 --> 37:21.600
Management.

37:21.600 --> 37:22.600
You have some things.

37:22.600 --> 37:23.600
Fill out.

37:23.600 --> 37:24.600
You will do like submit.

37:24.600 --> 37:26.600
So, document is already created.

37:26.600 --> 37:27.600
Okay.

37:27.600 --> 37:28.600
I will show you.

37:28.600 --> 37:29.600
Localhost.

37:29.600 --> 37:30.600
333.

37:30.600 --> 37:31.600
This is our entirety.

37:31.600 --> 37:32.600
We have opened.

37:32.600 --> 37:33.600
And the document.

37:33.600 --> 37:35.600
It is already created in the profile.

37:35.600 --> 37:36.600
In what name?

37:36.600 --> 37:39.600
The document of hacky recon is already created.

37:39.600 --> 37:40.600
And it has that old information.

37:40.600 --> 37:41.600
Hello world.

37:41.600 --> 37:42.600
All these things.

37:42.600 --> 37:43.600
123.

37:43.600 --> 37:44.600
Web dev.

37:44.600 --> 37:45.600
But as soon as I will save it here.

37:45.600 --> 37:46.600
Then it will change.

37:46.600 --> 37:47.600
This information.

37:47.600 --> 37:48.600
Because which method we used.

37:48.600 --> 37:49.600
Create and replace.

37:49.600 --> 37:50.600
If it already exists.

37:50.600 --> 37:51.600
Then replace it.

37:51.600 --> 37:52.600
If it doesn't.

37:52.600 --> 37:53.600
Then create it.

37:53.600 --> 37:54.600
As soon as you submit it.

37:54.600 --> 37:55.600
As soon as you submit it.

37:55.600 --> 37:56.600
It is loading.

37:56.600 --> 37:57.600
As soon as it is loaded.

37:57.600 --> 37:58.600
Here you are submitted.

37:58.600 --> 37:59.600
And this visit your portfolio.

37:59.600 --> 38:00.600
Has come here.

38:00.600 --> 38:01.600
Here is the URL.

38:01.600 --> 38:02.600
Here is the link.

38:02.600 --> 38:03.600
As soon as you click.

38:03.600 --> 38:04.600
Then you will come to your portfolio.

38:04.600 --> 38:05.600
Understood.

38:05.600 --> 38:06.600
What was this?

38:06.600 --> 38:07.600
How easy was it?

38:07.600 --> 38:08.600
What did we do?

38:08.600 --> 38:09.600
Visit your portfolio.

38:09.600 --> 38:10.600
So we know.

38:10.600 --> 38:11.600
How did we put it?

38:11.600 --> 38:12.600
Slash.

38:12.600 --> 38:13.600
Whatever is the ID of the user.

38:13.600 --> 38:14.600
Basically.

38:14.600 --> 38:15.600
Gmail ID.

38:15.600 --> 38:16.600
Its first part was picked up.

38:16.600 --> 38:17.600
From local storage.

38:17.600 --> 38:18.600
And in that only.

38:18.600 --> 38:19.600
The user will be redirected.

38:19.600 --> 38:20.600
So.

38:20.600 --> 38:21.600
The first part of Gmail ID.

38:21.600 --> 38:22.600
Is Techie Recon.

38:22.600 --> 38:23.600
And the user is redirected here.

38:23.600 --> 38:24.600
We have checked on the home page.

38:24.600 --> 38:25.600
That Techie Recon.

38:25.600 --> 38:26.600
Like Email ID.

38:26.600 --> 38:27.600
Exists.

38:27.600 --> 38:28.600
If it exists.

38:28.600 --> 38:29.600
Then show its data.

38:29.600 --> 38:30.600
And the data is shown.

38:30.600 --> 38:31.600
Techie Recon.

38:31.600 --> 38:32.600
Web Developer.

38:32.600 --> 38:33.600
Network Engineer.

38:33.600 --> 38:34.600
And the photo is also shown.
