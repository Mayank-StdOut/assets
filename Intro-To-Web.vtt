00:06.000 --> 00:08.000
Introduction to Web Development

00:08.000 --> 00:10.000
So what is web development?

00:10.000 --> 00:12.000
You already know this

00:12.000 --> 00:15.000
But let's see the basics of it

00:15.000 --> 00:18.000
You must have seen many websites around you

00:18.000 --> 00:23.000
You must be visiting Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn

00:23.000 --> 00:26.000
There are many sites that you must be visiting

00:26.000 --> 00:30.000
So basically making these sites is called web development

00:30.000 --> 00:32.000
Websites are also of many types

00:32.000 --> 00:37.000
One is static and the other is dynamic site

00:37.000 --> 00:39.000
What is static site?

00:39.000 --> 00:42.000
Static sites are simple landing pages

00:42.000 --> 00:48.000
In which there are only some images, some text and some basic things

00:48.000 --> 00:51.000
And there is not much interactivity in those sites

00:51.000 --> 00:56.000
There are many things in which there is a back-end requirement

00:56.000 --> 00:58.000
You don't do those things there

00:58.000 --> 01:02.000
But dynamic web applications like Instagram, Facebook

01:02.000 --> 01:06.000
Here you post something daily, delete something

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
You do a lot of things

01:08.000 --> 01:10.000
You also check people's profiles

01:10.000 --> 01:12.000
So everything changes dynamically

01:12.000 --> 01:15.000
So this is basically a dynamic site

01:15.000 --> 01:19.000
Where everything is functioning well from back-end to front-end

01:19.000 --> 01:24.000
Now let's see what is the basic requirement of making websites

01:24.000 --> 01:26.000
Now you must have seen all of you

01:26.000 --> 01:29.000
What is HTML, CSS and JavaScript?

01:29.000 --> 01:31.000
So basically what are these?

01:31.000 --> 01:34.000
These are the technologies by which you make websites

01:34.000 --> 01:37.000
Now these are very traditional things

01:37.000 --> 01:39.000
This is a traditional way of making websites

01:39.000 --> 01:44.000
A beginner develops websites by using HTML, CSS and JavaScript

01:44.000 --> 01:49.000
Now HTML defines the skeleton of your site

01:49.000 --> 01:51.000
That means here in your site

01:51.000 --> 01:54.000
For example I have shown you an example

01:54.000 --> 01:56.000
Here you can see the text

01:56.000 --> 01:57.000
There is a navigation bar

01:57.000 --> 01:58.000
There is a table below

01:58.000 --> 02:01.000
All these things are already defined in the code

02:01.000 --> 02:07.000
So this basic skeleton defines the HTML of any website

02:07.000 --> 02:09.000
Now let's see what is CSS

02:09.000 --> 02:14.000
CSS works for styling and adding beauty to the website

02:14.000 --> 02:17.000
Now you can see how beautiful a site looks

02:17.000 --> 02:20.000
The human, the astronaut and the earth

02:20.000 --> 02:23.000
All of this is made using CSS

02:23.000 --> 02:24.000
Right?

02:24.000 --> 02:26.000
After this you will see JavaScript

02:26.000 --> 02:28.000
So what is JavaScript?

02:28.000 --> 02:31.000
JavaScript basically works to put logic in any site

02:31.000 --> 02:34.000
That means it is the brain of any site

02:34.000 --> 02:35.000
So what was HTML?

02:35.000 --> 02:36.000
It was a skeleton

02:36.000 --> 02:38.000
The CSS is beauty

02:38.000 --> 02:40.000
And the JavaScript is the brain

02:40.000 --> 02:44.000
So basically any function that has to be executed in the site

02:44.000 --> 02:47.000
How should you look when you click any button

02:47.000 --> 02:50.000
Or for example when you submit a form

02:50.000 --> 02:51.000
So what should happen there

02:51.000 --> 02:53.000
All these things are defined in JavaScript

02:54.000 --> 02:55.000
Now here

02:55.000 --> 02:57.000
Now let's see one more thing

02:57.000 --> 03:00.000
How does a website work?

03:00.000 --> 03:02.000
Now how does a website work?

03:02.000 --> 03:05.000
Here it has a very simple demonstration

03:05.000 --> 03:08.000
Here we have a client

03:08.000 --> 03:09.000
Client means you

03:09.000 --> 03:12.000
For example you have opened a Chrome browser in your computer

03:12.000 --> 03:14.000
Or any browser

03:14.000 --> 03:17.000
Now you search the name of any website from there

03:17.000 --> 03:18.000
For example Google.com

03:18.000 --> 03:20.000
You searched Google.com

03:20.000 --> 03:23.000
Now what happens is that it goes to Google's server

03:23.000 --> 03:25.000
Now there are things like DNS here

03:25.000 --> 03:27.000
But we are looking at basic things

03:27.000 --> 03:29.000
So the request goes to Google's server

03:29.000 --> 03:33.000
Now the server sends the response of that request

03:33.000 --> 03:35.000
And what does it send in response?

03:35.000 --> 03:36.000
It sends these files

03:36.000 --> 03:39.000
First it does a lot of checks on the server

03:39.000 --> 03:41.000
But we don't want to see that

03:41.000 --> 03:46.000
Now the server basically sends you the files of HTML, CSS and JavaScript

03:46.000 --> 03:48.000
Which displays your browser

03:48.000 --> 03:50.000
Then you see a website

03:50.000 --> 03:51.000
Okay

03:51.000 --> 03:53.000
So this is happening like this

03:53.000 --> 03:55.000
This is what happens

03:55.000 --> 03:57.000
Now apart from this

03:57.000 --> 03:59.000
We have got this position

03:59.000 --> 04:00.000
That the basic technologies

04:00.000 --> 04:03.000
That is HTML, CSS and JavaScript

04:03.000 --> 04:05.000
I said this traditional because

04:05.000 --> 04:09.000
Because now no one uses it

04:09.000 --> 04:12.000
That is, no one uses HTML, CSS and JavaScript in a plain way

04:12.000 --> 04:14.000
They are used there

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
But now there are many frameworks

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
Using which websites are made

04:18.000 --> 04:19.000
For example

04:19.000 --> 04:21.000
There is a library of JavaScript

04:21.000 --> 04:22.000
Which we call React

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000
Now what does React do?

04:24.000 --> 04:26.000
React basically does what?

04:26.000 --> 04:29.000
That the website making experience that you have

04:29.000 --> 04:32.000
Which is made using JavaScript, HTML and all these

04:32.000 --> 04:35.000
It makes it easy and convenient

04:35.000 --> 04:37.000
And apart from this it is very fast

04:37.000 --> 04:40.000
And it helps a lot in making single page applications

04:40.000 --> 04:41.000
That is

04:41.000 --> 04:43.000
When you make a normal website

04:43.000 --> 04:45.000
So you will see that when you switch to the page

04:45.000 --> 04:47.000
Then it will be reloaded

04:47.000 --> 04:48.000
But

04:48.000 --> 04:50.000
React applications are not reloaded

04:50.000 --> 04:51.000
They are directly

04:52.000 --> 04:54.000
Switched from one page to another page

04:54.000 --> 04:55.000
Without reloading

04:55.000 --> 04:57.000
This is not just the specialty of React

04:57.000 --> 04:59.000
Apart from this there are many more things

04:59.000 --> 05:00.000
Now

05:00.000 --> 05:02.000
All the modern day websites of today

05:02.000 --> 05:04.000
You can say

05:04.000 --> 05:05.000
Instagram is done

05:05.000 --> 05:06.000
And Facebook is done

05:06.000 --> 05:08.000
Such sites are made in React

05:08.000 --> 05:10.000
React is being used in them

05:10.000 --> 05:13.000
And React was developed by Facebook

05:13.000 --> 05:14.000
And

05:14.000 --> 05:15.000
Here you can see

05:15.000 --> 05:17.000
All the sites that I have put here

05:17.000 --> 05:18.000
For example

05:18.000 --> 05:21.000
You can make all types of sites with React

05:22.000 --> 05:23.000
Now apart from this

05:23.000 --> 05:26.000
We will see how React works

05:26.000 --> 05:30.000
React works on a virtual DOM method

05:30.000 --> 05:31.000
That is

05:31.000 --> 05:32.000
What happens is

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
When you update something in the site

05:34.000 --> 05:35.000
Normally

05:35.000 --> 05:36.000
Now we remove React

05:36.000 --> 05:37.000
So what happens is

05:37.000 --> 05:40.000
It is updated directly

05:40.000 --> 05:41.000
All the elements of the website

05:41.000 --> 05:43.000
They are directly updated

05:43.000 --> 05:44.000
But

05:44.000 --> 05:45.000
The React

05:45.000 --> 05:47.000
It creates a virtual DOM

05:47.000 --> 05:48.000
Between these two

05:48.000 --> 05:49.000
That is

05:49.000 --> 05:50.000
What is virtual DOM?

05:50.000 --> 05:52.000
Let's see what DOM is first

05:52.000 --> 05:54.000
Let me tell you the most basic way

05:54.000 --> 05:56.000
All the elements in your site

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
From the HTML tag to the bottom

05:58.000 --> 05:59.000
All of them

05:59.000 --> 06:00.000
To the closing tag

06:00.000 --> 06:01.000
All of them

06:01.000 --> 06:03.000
All of them come in the DOM of a website

06:03.000 --> 06:04.000
That is

06:04.000 --> 06:05.000
One element

06:05.000 --> 06:06.000
Then one element in it

06:06.000 --> 06:08.000
Then another element in it

06:08.000 --> 06:09.000
By doing this

06:09.000 --> 06:10.000
The website

06:10.000 --> 06:12.000
It creates a tree-like structure

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
In which elements come in elements

06:14.000 --> 06:15.000
So that is your

06:15.000 --> 06:17.000
That is basically a DOM

06:17.000 --> 06:18.000
Okay

06:18.000 --> 06:19.000
Now that DOM

06:19.000 --> 06:21.000
What JavaScript does there

06:21.000 --> 06:22.000
What JavaScript does

06:22.000 --> 06:24.000
It copies the actual DOM

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
And creates a virtual DOM

06:26.000 --> 06:27.000
Now whatever you change

06:27.000 --> 06:30.000
It changes in this virtual DOM

06:30.000 --> 06:34.000
As soon as that thing changes in the virtual DOM

06:34.000 --> 06:35.000
It

06:35.000 --> 06:36.000
It is pushed again

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
In the actual DOM of the browser

06:38.000 --> 06:41.000
Let me explain this in a more basic way

06:41.000 --> 06:42.000
So let's assume

06:42.000 --> 06:43.000
You have an element

06:43.000 --> 06:44.000
It is a div element

06:44.000 --> 06:46.000
In which you have put some text

06:46.000 --> 06:49.000
You have put a heading tag in it

06:49.000 --> 06:51.000
Now when you update normally

06:51.000 --> 06:53.000
It gets directly updated

06:53.000 --> 06:54.000
But

06:54.000 --> 06:55.000
When you

06:55.000 --> 06:58.000
Use libraries like react

06:58.000 --> 06:59.000
So what happens

06:59.000 --> 07:00.000
That react first

07:00.000 --> 07:02.000
The actual DOM of the browser

07:02.000 --> 07:03.000
In which

07:03.000 --> 07:04.000
The actual elements

07:04.000 --> 07:05.000
It makes a copy of them

07:05.000 --> 07:06.000
Then

07:06.000 --> 07:07.000
Whatever you change

07:07.000 --> 07:09.000
It puts it in that copy

07:09.000 --> 07:10.000
And

07:10.000 --> 07:11.000
Then finally

07:11.000 --> 07:12.000
That copy

07:12.000 --> 07:15.000
It changes in the actual DOM

07:15.000 --> 07:16.000
What happens here

07:16.000 --> 07:17.000
Time is saved

07:17.000 --> 07:18.000
That is

07:18.000 --> 07:19.000
You don't have to call the actual DOM

07:19.000 --> 07:21.000
Again and again

07:21.000 --> 07:24.000
You don't have to see the actual DOM again and again

07:24.000 --> 07:26.000
Things happen in the virtual DOM

07:26.000 --> 07:28.000
Then it passes in the actual DOM

07:28.000 --> 07:30.000
Which happens in a very easy way

07:30.000 --> 07:32.000
If you haven't understood this thing yet

07:32.000 --> 07:33.000
Then it doesn't matter

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
We will understand it in the future

07:35.000 --> 07:36.000
After this

07:36.000 --> 07:37.000
Let's see

07:37.000 --> 07:39.000
Why do we use the react framework

07:39.000 --> 07:41.000
And why do we learn this

07:41.000 --> 07:42.000
See

07:42.000 --> 07:43.000
All the frameworks

07:43.000 --> 07:44.000
In today's time

07:44.000 --> 07:45.000
Of that

07:45.000 --> 07:46.000
The most

07:46.000 --> 07:47.000
That is

07:47.000 --> 07:48.000
That react

07:48.000 --> 07:49.000
Is being used

07:49.000 --> 07:50.000
Now the thing

07:50.000 --> 07:51.000
Which is used the most

07:51.000 --> 07:52.000
The thing

07:52.000 --> 07:53.000
Which is used the most

07:53.000 --> 07:54.000
By the developers

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
It will be used in the industry

07:56.000 --> 07:57.000
Because

07:57.000 --> 07:59.000
These things are going on in the industry

07:59.000 --> 08:00.000
That's why so many people

08:00.000 --> 08:01.000
Are using it

08:01.000 --> 08:02.000
So this is a very trending skill

08:02.000 --> 08:03.000
And

08:03.000 --> 08:04.000
Not just now

08:04.000 --> 08:05.000
For a long time

08:05.000 --> 08:06.000
React

08:06.000 --> 08:07.000
Is at the top

08:07.000 --> 08:08.000
So you have to learn this

08:08.000 --> 08:09.000
Absolutely

08:10.000 --> 08:11.000
So this was our

08:11.000 --> 08:12.000
Basic

08:12.000 --> 08:13.000
Web Development

08:13.000 --> 08:14.000
Introduction
