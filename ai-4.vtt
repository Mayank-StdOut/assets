00:06.000 --> 00:12.000
Now we will see how to summarize the text after scraping.

00:12.000 --> 00:17.000
For this, we will need the API key of OpenAI.

00:17.000 --> 00:27.000
Because we will send our scraped text to OpenAI and from there the text will be summarized through AI and you will get the result.

00:27.000 --> 00:40.000
For this, we will first have to set up the OpenAI account and after taking the API key, we will have to set the method in this section to summarize.

00:40.000 --> 00:53.000
For this, we will first go to our Chrome browser and there you have to go to platform.openai.com and create an account.

00:53.000 --> 00:55.000
How will you create an account?

00:55.000 --> 00:56.000
You have to give your email.

00:56.000 --> 00:57.000
Your phone number.

00:57.000 --> 01:01.000
And as soon as you give these two things, your account will be created.

01:01.000 --> 01:09.000
And as soon as your account is created, you have to click here in the top right corner.

01:09.000 --> 01:12.000
If you click in the top right corner, you will get the view API keys.

01:12.000 --> 01:16.000
If you click here, you will reach the page where I am.

01:16.000 --> 01:19.000
So here you will see your API keys.

01:19.000 --> 01:22.000
Either you will be able to create API keys here.

01:22.000 --> 01:26.000
After that, first of all, you have to create an account, which is a very simple process.

01:26.000 --> 01:32.000
As I told you, you have to set up your account in platform.openai.com.

01:32.000 --> 01:35.000
You have to enter your email, phone number, and verify it.

01:35.000 --> 01:37.000
After that, your account will be created.

01:37.000 --> 01:38.000
This is absolutely free.

01:38.000 --> 01:40.000
It will not cost you money at all.

01:40.000 --> 01:41.000
It is your free account.

01:41.000 --> 01:43.000
So you will go to usage.

01:43.000 --> 01:48.000
If you go to usage, then you will definitely see here that it should not be written expired anywhere.

01:48.000 --> 01:50.000
It should not be written expired anywhere.

01:50.000 --> 01:54.000
If it is written expired anywhere after making your account.

01:54.000 --> 01:57.000
This means that you have already created an account.

01:57.000 --> 01:59.000
With the same number, with the same email.

01:59.000 --> 02:02.000
So your validity has expired.

02:02.000 --> 02:07.000
So we have got this free trial for 1 February.

02:07.000 --> 02:10.000
And we have been given credit up to $5.

02:10.000 --> 02:19.000
So here you also have to see that your free trial is completely white and not expired anywhere.

02:19.000 --> 02:21.000
If something is written like this.

02:21.000 --> 02:22.000
If something is written after being expired.

02:22.000 --> 02:23.000
Then you have to create an account again.

02:24.000 --> 02:28.000
A new account where you have to enter a new number and email.

02:28.000 --> 02:31.000
Most of the time this will not happen with you at all.

02:31.000 --> 02:33.000
But you can do something like this.

02:33.000 --> 02:35.000
Now here what you have to do first.

02:35.000 --> 02:39.000
That you have to go to your API keys section.

02:39.000 --> 02:43.000
And here you have to create a new API key.

02:43.000 --> 02:45.000
So you will write here.

02:45.000 --> 02:48.000
Here you see an API key.

02:48.000 --> 02:51.000
Here I have already made it in the name of Chrome extension.

02:51.000 --> 02:52.000
So I will delete it first.

02:52.000 --> 02:53.000
And you have to.

02:53.000 --> 02:58.000
To show how API key is created.

02:58.000 --> 02:59.000
I will delete it first.

02:59.000 --> 03:00.000
So what you will do for that.

03:00.000 --> 03:02.000
First you will go to create new secret.

03:02.000 --> 03:04.000
Which is the plus button.

03:04.000 --> 03:06.000
In this you will write my API.

03:06.000 --> 03:09.000
You can name the API key with any name.

03:09.000 --> 03:12.000
And as soon as you click create secret.

03:12.000 --> 03:16.000
So here your key has been created.

03:16.000 --> 03:18.000
Now you have to verify here.

03:18.000 --> 03:20.000
So you go to the begin puzzle.

03:20.000 --> 03:21.000
You can verify.

03:21.000 --> 03:22.000
So I will verify it quickly.

03:23.000 --> 03:25.000
And I will verify it here.

03:25.000 --> 03:27.000
I will submit it.

03:27.000 --> 03:29.000
And then again quickly.

03:29.000 --> 03:31.000
I will verify it.

03:31.000 --> 03:33.000
And I will submit it.

03:33.000 --> 03:35.000
I don't know what all they do.

03:35.000 --> 03:37.000
But it is fine.

03:37.000 --> 03:39.000
Ok.

03:39.000 --> 03:41.000
So now hopefully all this has been done.

03:41.000 --> 03:43.000
Verification.

03:43.000 --> 03:45.000
Now here you will see your API key.

03:45.000 --> 03:46.000
You will copy it.

03:46.000 --> 03:48.000
And remember once.

03:48.000 --> 03:51.000
That you get to see the API key only once.

03:51.000 --> 03:52.000
At the time when you make it.

03:52.000 --> 03:54.000
After that you will not see it.

03:54.000 --> 03:56.000
You do it done.

03:56.000 --> 03:57.000
And after that.

03:57.000 --> 04:00.000
Here I will remove the old API key from here.

04:00.000 --> 04:01.000
Which I don't need.

04:01.000 --> 04:04.000
Because here we have made a just new API key.

04:04.000 --> 04:07.000
So for this also we have to do the puzzle.

04:07.000 --> 04:09.000
I will do it quickly.

04:09.000 --> 04:10.000
Or I will remove it.

04:10.000 --> 04:11.000
Now I don't remove it.

04:11.000 --> 04:13.000
Why waste so much time.

04:13.000 --> 04:15.000
I will cancel it.

04:15.000 --> 04:16.000
Ok.

04:16.000 --> 04:17.000
One more thing.

04:17.000 --> 04:20.000
I will delete the API key after the video is over.

04:20.000 --> 04:21.000
After the project is over.

04:21.000 --> 04:22.000
I will delete it.

04:22.000 --> 04:26.000
So you don't try to use this API key.

04:26.000 --> 04:28.000
So what we will do here.

04:28.000 --> 04:30.000
You will go back.

04:30.000 --> 04:32.000
And we will go back.

04:32.000 --> 04:34.000
After minimizing it.

04:34.000 --> 04:36.000
And here first of all.

04:36.000 --> 04:38.000
We will comment out our API key.

04:38.000 --> 04:39.000
Go here.

04:39.000 --> 04:42.000
We will comment the API key.

04:42.000 --> 04:44.000
So this is our API key.

04:44.000 --> 04:47.000
You must have also got some of this type of API key.

04:47.000 --> 04:49.000
Now after this.

04:49.000 --> 04:50.000
First thing.

04:50.000 --> 04:55.000
The API request that we have to send.

04:55.000 --> 04:58.000
That will go to our OpenAI.

04:58.000 --> 05:01.000
So for that we have to make an API URL first.

05:01.000 --> 05:02.000
On which request will be sent.

05:02.000 --> 05:04.000
So const openai.

05:04.000 --> 05:06.000
We give it a variable by doing URL.

05:06.000 --> 05:11.000
In which you have to put the URL of openai.

05:11.000 --> 05:13.000
So here I have that URL.

05:13.000 --> 05:15.000
So first I will put it directly here.

05:15.000 --> 05:17.000
So here is that URL.

05:17.000 --> 05:19.000
You have to type the same URL here.

05:19.000 --> 05:20.000
After this.

05:20.000 --> 05:22.000
Remember that all these things that you are doing.

05:22.000 --> 05:23.000
They should be in this.

05:23.000 --> 05:25.000
In if condition.

05:25.000 --> 05:28.000
Because the scraped text that we have to send.

05:28.000 --> 05:31.000
We will get it from this if condition.

05:31.000 --> 05:33.000
After this.

05:33.000 --> 05:35.000
The second thing is.

05:35.000 --> 05:38.000
You have to make a URL for API key.

05:38.000 --> 05:40.000
So we make a URL for API key.

05:40.000 --> 05:41.000
So.

05:41.000 --> 05:43.000
const.

05:43.000 --> 05:44.000
API.

05:44.000 --> 05:46.000
Underscore key.

05:46.000 --> 05:48.000
In this our API key.

05:48.000 --> 05:50.000
We copy that.

05:50.000 --> 05:52.000
And then.

05:52.000 --> 05:54.000
Paste it.

05:54.000 --> 05:56.000
So our API key.

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
Has also come here.

05:58.000 --> 05:59.000
After this.

05:59.000 --> 06:00.000
The second thing that comes.

06:00.000 --> 06:01.000
That is.

06:01.000 --> 06:03.000
Now our scraped text data.

06:03.000 --> 06:05.000
Scraped text.

06:05.000 --> 06:07.000
This API has a limit.

06:07.000 --> 06:10.000
It can process only some words.

06:10.000 --> 06:13.000
Some 200 to 300 words.

06:13.000 --> 06:15.000
It can process.

06:15.000 --> 06:16.000
And.

06:16.000 --> 06:17.000
This field.

06:17.000 --> 06:18.000
And.

06:18.000 --> 06:19.000
This free version.

06:19.000 --> 06:22.000
It can process only 100 words with difficulty.

06:22.000 --> 06:24.000
So we have to keep this in mind.

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
That the text that we will give.

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
It is of only 100 words.

06:28.000 --> 06:29.000
If we give text above it.

06:29.000 --> 06:31.000
Then we do not get any result of API.

06:31.000 --> 06:33.000
We will show error.

06:33.000 --> 06:35.000
So we have to send only 100 words.

06:35.000 --> 06:36.000
To API.

06:36.000 --> 06:37.000
First.

06:37.000 --> 06:39.000
We have scraped the whole web page content.

06:39.000 --> 06:40.000
But we have to send only 100 words.

06:40.000 --> 06:41.000
And.

06:41.000 --> 06:42.000
Believe me.

06:42.000 --> 06:43.000
That is enough.

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
To summarize your web page.

06:45.000 --> 06:46.000
And we will see that now.

06:46.000 --> 06:47.000
So.

06:47.000 --> 06:48.000
For this.

06:48.000 --> 06:49.000
What we have to do.

06:49.000 --> 06:50.000
We have to use a method.

06:50.000 --> 06:51.000
By which we.

06:51.000 --> 06:52.000
Whatever our web page.

06:52.000 --> 06:53.000
Whatever our content will be.

06:53.000 --> 06:54.000
We can.

06:54.000 --> 06:55.000
Make it smaller.

06:55.000 --> 06:56.000
And.

06:56.000 --> 06:57.000
And make it 100 words.

06:57.000 --> 06:58.000
So what we will do for that.

06:58.000 --> 06:59.000
We will make a variable named string.

06:59.000 --> 07:00.000
And.

07:00.000 --> 07:01.000
What will we save in it.

07:01.000 --> 07:02.000
Message dot scraped text.

07:02.000 --> 07:03.000
Dot scraped text.

07:03.000 --> 07:04.000
This is saved in it.

07:04.000 --> 07:05.000
After this.

07:05.000 --> 07:06.000
What will we do.

07:06.000 --> 07:07.000
We will make a variable named words.

07:07.000 --> 07:08.000
In which.

07:08.000 --> 07:09.000
Whatever.

07:09.000 --> 07:10.000
In it.

07:10.000 --> 07:11.000
What we will do.

07:11.000 --> 07:12.000
We will make a variable named words.

07:12.000 --> 07:13.000
In which.

07:13.000 --> 07:14.000
Whatever.

07:14.000 --> 07:15.000
In it.

07:15.000 --> 07:16.000
Whatever.

07:16.000 --> 07:17.000
Message.

07:17.000 --> 07:18.000
In scraped text.

07:18.000 --> 07:19.000
Whatever.

07:19.000 --> 07:20.000
Things.

07:20.000 --> 07:21.000
We will split it.

07:21.000 --> 07:22.000
Meaning.

07:22.000 --> 07:23.000
String.

07:23.000 --> 07:24.000
Dot.

07:24.000 --> 07:25.000
Split.

07:25.000 --> 07:26.000
And.

07:26.000 --> 07:27.000
We will make it separate.

07:27.000 --> 07:28.000
We will make all the words separate.

07:28.000 --> 07:29.000
This method.

07:29.000 --> 07:30.000
And.

07:30.000 --> 07:31.000
For example.

07:31.000 --> 07:32.000
There.

07:32.000 --> 07:33.000
It is written.

07:33.000 --> 07:34.000
The quick brown fox.

07:34.000 --> 07:35.000
So.

07:35.000 --> 07:36.000
Da will be separate.

07:36.000 --> 07:37.000
Quick will be separate.

07:37.000 --> 07:38.000
Brown will be separate.

07:38.000 --> 07:39.000
So.

07:39.000 --> 07:40.000
All the values will be stored in a separate array.

07:40.000 --> 07:41.000
I will show you.

07:41.000 --> 07:42.000
This thing.

07:42.000 --> 07:43.000
Once.

07:43.000 --> 07:44.000
By doing this.

07:44.000 --> 07:45.000
I will show you.

07:45.000 --> 07:46.000
How to give words.

07:46.000 --> 07:47.000
So.

07:47.000 --> 07:48.000
Console.

07:48.000 --> 07:49.000
Dot.

07:49.000 --> 07:50.000
Log.

07:50.000 --> 07:51.000
And.

07:51.000 --> 07:52.000
Here.

07:52.000 --> 07:53.000
I write words.

07:53.000 --> 07:54.000
Like.

07:54.000 --> 07:55.000
And.

07:55.000 --> 07:56.000
Here.

07:56.000 --> 07:57.000
After this.

07:57.000 --> 07:58.000
Once.

07:58.000 --> 07:59.000
I go to the browser.

07:59.000 --> 08:00.000
Once.

08:00.000 --> 08:01.000
I show you.

08:01.000 --> 08:02.000
What will happen.

08:02.000 --> 08:03.000
So.

08:03.000 --> 08:04.000
Once.

08:04.000 --> 08:05.000
We go to the browser.

08:05.000 --> 08:06.000
Our.

08:06.000 --> 08:07.000
Browser.

08:07.000 --> 08:08.000
Here.

08:08.000 --> 08:09.000
Once.

08:09.000 --> 08:10.000
Click.

08:10.000 --> 08:11.000
Hello.

08:11.000 --> 08:12.000
Word.

08:12.000 --> 08:13.000
And.

08:13.000 --> 08:14.000
Before.

08:14.000 --> 08:15.000
We.

08:15.000 --> 08:16.000
Download.

08:16.000 --> 08:17.000
Open.

08:17.000 --> 08:18.000
Extension.

08:18.000 --> 08:19.000
Hello.

08:19.000 --> 08:20.000
Word.

08:20.000 --> 08:21.000
Click.

08:21.000 --> 08:22.000
We.

08:22.000 --> 08:23.000
Go to.

08:23.000 --> 08:24.000
Inspection.

08:24.000 --> 08:25.000
Console.

08:25.000 --> 08:26.000
So.

08:26.000 --> 08:27.000
See.

08:27.000 --> 08:28.000
One.

08:28.000 --> 08:29.000
Array.

08:29.000 --> 08:30.000
Comes.

08:30.000 --> 08:31.000
In which.

08:31.000 --> 08:32.000
Whole.

08:32.000 --> 08:33.000
Whole.

08:33.000 --> 08:34.000
Word.

08:34.000 --> 08:35.000
Split.

08:35.000 --> 08:36.000
You will get.

08:36.000 --> 08:37.000
See.

08:37.000 --> 08:38.000
See.

08:38.000 --> 08:39.000
One.

08:39.000 --> 08:40.000
One.

08:40.000 --> 08:41.000
Word.

08:41.000 --> 08:42.000
Split.

08:42.000 --> 08:43.000
Whole.

08:43.000 --> 08:44.000
Now.

08:44.000 --> 08:45.000
What.

08:45.000 --> 08:46.000
Will.

08:46.000 --> 08:47.000
We.

Only.

08:48.000 --> 08:49.000
100.

08:49.000 --> 08:50.000
Words.

08:50.000 --> 08:51.000
Will.

08:51.000 --> 08:52.000
Keep.

08:52.000 --> 08:53.000
And.

08:53.000 --> 08:54.000
Other.

08:54.000 --> 08:55.000

08:55.000 --> 08:56.000
Will.

08:56.000 --> 08:57.000
Remove.

08:57.000 --> 08:58.000
For.

08:58.000 --> 08:59.000
This.

08:59.000 --> 09:00.000
Now.

09:00.000 --> 09:01.000
What.

09:01.000 --> 09:02.000
Will.

09:02.000 --> 09:03.000
We.

09:03.000 --> 09:04.000
Go.

09:04.000 --> 09:05.000

09:12.000 --> 09:13.000
Now.

09:13.000 --> 09:14.000
We.

09:14.000 --> 09:15.000
Will.

09:15.000 --> 09:16.000
Get.

09:16.000 --> 09:17.000
Only.

09:17.000 --> 09:18.000
100.

09:18.000 --> 09:19.000
Words.

09:19.000 --> 09:20.000
Using.

09:20.000 --> 09:21.000
This.

09:21.000 --> 09:22.000
Method.

09:22.000 --> 09:23.000
If.

09:23.000 --> 09:24.000
You.

09:24.000 --> 09:25.000
Write.

09:25.000 --> 09:26.000
200.

09:26.000 --> 09:27.000
Then.

09:27.000 --> 09:28.000
200.

09:28.000 --> 09:29.000
Will.

09:29.000 --> 09:30.000
Get.

09:30.000 --> 09:31.000
300.

09:31.000 --> 09:32.000

09:32.000 --> 09:33.000
Will.

09:33.000 --> 09:34.000

09:36.000 --> 09:37.000
So.

09:37.000 --> 09:38.000
How.

09:38.000 --> 09:39.000
Much.

09:39.000 --> 09:40.000
You.

09:40.000 --> 09:41.000
Specify.

09:41.000 --> 09:42.000
The.

09:42.000 --> 09:43.000
Text.

09:43.000 --> 09:44.000
We.

09:44.000 --> 09:45.000
Will.

09:45.000 --> 09:46.000
Save.

09:46.000 --> 09:47.000
That.

09:47.000 --> 09:48.000
Means.

09:48.000 --> 09:49.000
I.

09:49.000 --> 09:50.000
Tell.

09:50.000 --> 09:51.000
You.

09:51.000 --> 09:52.000
What.

09:52.000 --> 09:53.000
Will.

09:53.000 --> 09:54.000
Do.

09:54.000 --> 09:55.000
Here.

09:55.000 --> 09:56.000
What.

09:56.000 --> 09:57.000
We.

09:57.000 --> 09:58.000
Did.

09:58.000 --> 09:59.000
That.

09:59.000 --> 10:00.000
Our.

10:00.000 --> 10:01.000
Text.

10:01.000 --> 10:02.000
Extracted.

10:02.000 --> 10:03.000
We.

10:03.000 --> 10:04.000
Made.

10:04.000 --> 10:05.000
100.

10:05.000 --> 10:06.000
Words.

10:06.000 --> 10:07.000
So.

10:07.000 --> 10:08.000
Message.

10:08.000 --> 10:09.000
Script.

10:09.000 --> 10:10.000
Text.

10:10.000 --> 10:11.000
100.

10:11.000 --> 10:12.000
Words.

10:12.000 --> 10:13.000
Okay.

10:13.000 --> 10:14.000
Now.

10:14.000 --> 10:15.000
We.

10:15.000 --> 10:16.000
Can.

10:16.000 --> 10:17.000
Process.

10:17.000 --> 10:18.000
This.

10:18.000 --> 10:19.000
In.

10:19.000 --> 10:20.000
Our.

10:20.000 --> 10:21.000
API.

10:21.000 --> 10:22.000
Now.

10:22.000 --> 10:23.000
You.

10:23.000 --> 10:24.000
Have.

10:24.000 --> 10:25.000
To.

10:25.000 --> 10:26.000
Process.

10:26.000 --> 10:27.000
First.

10:27.000 --> 10:28.000
You.

10:28.000 --> 10:29.000
Have.

10:29.000 --> 10:30.000
To.

10:30.000 --> 10:31.000
Make.

10:31.000 --> 10:32.000
An.

10:32.000 --> 10:33.000
Object.

10:33.000 --> 10:34.000
By.

10:34.000 --> 10:35.000
Data.

10:35.000 --> 10:36.000
And.

10:36.000 --> 10:37.000
You.

10:37.000 --> 10:38.000
Have.

10:38.000 --> 10:39.000
To.

10:39.000 --> 10:40.000
Use.

10:40.000 --> 10:41.000
So.

10:41.000 --> 10:42.000
So.

10:42.000 --> 10:43.000
Let's.

10:43.000 --> 10:44.000
Specify.

10:44.000 --> 10:45.000
Some.

10:45.000 --> 10:46.000
Things.

10:46.000 --> 10:47.000
So.

10:47.000 --> 10:48.000
This.

10:48.000 --> 10:49.000
Is.

10:49.000 --> 10:50.000
Specified.

10:50.000 --> 10:51.000
So.

10:51.000 --> 10:52.000
The.

10:52.000 --> 10:53.000
First.

10:53.000 --> 10:54.000
Thing.

10:54.000 --> 10:55.000
To.

10:55.000 --> 10:56.000
Specify.

10:56.000 --> 10:57.000
Is.

10:57.000 --> 10:58.000
Model.

10:58.000 --> 10:59.000
And.

10:59.000 --> 11:00.000
Messages.

11:00.000 --> 11:01.000
For.

11:01.000 --> 11:02.000
That.

11:02.000 --> 11:03.000
We.

11:03.000 --> 11:04.000
Will.

11:04.000 --> 11:05.000
Use.

11:05.000 --> 11:06.000
As.

11:06.000 --> 11:07.000
A.

11:07.000 --> 11:08.000
Model.

11:08.000 --> 11:23.000
You have to enter the name of the chat GPT, here GPT-4 is also available, GPT-3.5 is also available, so you will not be able to get GPT-4 in the free version, but you have this model available, so you can do this.

11:23.000 --> 11:41.000
After that, we gave a role of user content, and we gave the same to you, you have to summarize the message.script text content for the content.

11:41.000 --> 11:53.000
So we gave a prompt basically, summarize this in a single paragraph, give this text in a single paragraph, and that text is message.script text.

11:53.000 --> 11:57.000
and this is what we made of the 100 words

11:57.000 --> 11:59.000
so now you must have understood

11:59.000 --> 12:01.000
this went into our data

12:01.000 --> 12:03.000
now the second thing will go

12:03.000 --> 12:05.000
that is

12:05.000 --> 12:07.000
how many

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
number of tokens and all these things come

12:09.000 --> 12:11.000
so what will you do for this, first you will go down

12:11.000 --> 12:13.000
from the message area

12:13.000 --> 12:15.000
here you will define some things

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
like max

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
tokens

12:19.000 --> 12:21.000
or I will give you this whole thing in the code section

12:21.000 --> 12:23.000
this is nothing

12:23.000 --> 12:25.000
some 3-4 line properties

12:25.000 --> 12:27.000
you can define something like this

12:27.000 --> 12:29.000
here we have given some things like

12:29.000 --> 12:31.000
max tokens and these are some things

12:31.000 --> 12:33.000
which you don't need to pay attention to

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
so these are all things

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
and the main thing here is the max token

12:37.000 --> 12:39.000
what it tells

12:39.000 --> 12:41.000
that according to some words

12:41.000 --> 12:43.000
there are tokens here

12:43.000 --> 12:45.000
i.e. there are 16000 tokens

12:45.000 --> 12:47.000
so we can process only some words

12:47.000 --> 12:49.000
so tokens basically tell you how many

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
number of words you can process at once

12:51.000 --> 12:53.000
so you can't increase it

12:53.000 --> 12:55.000
because the capability of this model is

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
that it can process 16000 tokens

12:57.000 --> 12:59.000
and one token

12:59.000 --> 13:01.000
is equivalent to 1.2 text

13:01.000 --> 13:03.000
or

13:03.000 --> 13:05.000
one token is equivalent to 2 text

13:05.000 --> 13:07.000
so it is 16000

13:07.000 --> 13:09.000
so it can do

13:09.000 --> 13:11.000
some 32000 words

13:11.000 --> 13:13.000
but again

13:13.000 --> 13:15.000
this is a free version

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
so we can only do 100 words

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
if you had paid for this

13:19.000 --> 13:21.000
then you would have done

13:21.000 --> 13:23.000
32000 words

13:23.000 --> 13:25.000
ok

13:25.000 --> 13:27.000
so this is all

13:27.000 --> 13:29.000
now what we have to do

13:29.000 --> 13:31.000
we have to create a function

13:31.000 --> 13:33.000
by which we can

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
send the API scrap text

13:35.000 --> 13:37.000
now we have just defined the properties

13:37.000 --> 13:39.000
what to send

13:39.000 --> 13:41.000
how to send

13:41.000 --> 13:43.000
which model to use

13:43.000 --> 13:45.000
now we have to define

13:45.000 --> 13:47.000
what things

13:47.000 --> 13:49.000
we want to use

13:49.000 --> 13:51.000
so for this we will go down

13:51.000 --> 13:53.000
and this function

13:53.000 --> 13:55.000
which we have already created

13:55.000 --> 13:57.000
you have to use this

13:57.000 --> 13:59.000
what it will do

13:59.000 --> 14:01.000
I will tell you

14:01.000 --> 14:03.000
here this response

14:03.000 --> 14:05.000
variable

14:05.000 --> 14:07.000
what it will do

14:07.000 --> 14:09.000
as a body

14:09.000 --> 14:11.000
it will put

14:11.000 --> 14:13.000
this data

14:13.000 --> 14:15.000
first of all

14:15.000 --> 14:17.000
it will convert this data

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
into a string

14:19.000 --> 14:21.000
and it will send

14:21.000 --> 14:23.000
method post

14:23.000 --> 14:25.000
means it is sending a request

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
to openai

14:27.000 --> 14:29.000
and then in the authorisation

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
your API will be done

14:31.000 --> 14:33.000
after doing this

14:33.000 --> 14:35.000
whatever code you have

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
is set up

14:37.000 --> 14:39.000
to send a request to openai

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
now some things are left

14:41.000 --> 14:43.000
which are here

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
here some things are left

14:45.000 --> 14:47.000
like

14:47.000 --> 14:49.000
second thing is this

14:49.000 --> 14:51.000
whatever response data

14:51.000 --> 14:53.000
you will get

14:53.000 --> 14:55.000
means whatever response

14:55.000 --> 14:57.000
you got from API

14:57.000 --> 14:59.000
you have to save that too

14:59.000 --> 15:01.000
so for that what you do

15:01.000 --> 15:03.000
first of all you make a variable

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
called response data

15:05.000 --> 15:07.000
in that the response

15:07.000 --> 15:09.000
that we get from openai

15:09.000 --> 15:11.000
we convert it to json

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
and then by doing message from response

15:13.000 --> 15:15.000
we make a separate variable

15:15.000 --> 15:17.000
in which

15:17.000 --> 15:19.000
the object called response data

15:19.000 --> 15:21.000
in that we extract the

15:21.000 --> 15:23.000
message.content

15:23.000 --> 15:25.000
value or key

15:25.000 --> 15:27.000
so let me explain this to you

15:27.000 --> 15:29.000
what we have done

15:29.000 --> 15:31.000
so first we comment this

15:31.000 --> 15:33.000
as soon as we comment this

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
after this we will do one thing

15:35.000 --> 15:37.000
we will do console.log

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
here we will

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
response.json

15:41.000 --> 15:43.000
whatever response we will get

15:43.000 --> 15:45.000
we have logged it here

15:45.000 --> 15:47.000
so you must have understood

15:47.000 --> 15:49.000
that we have set up API first

15:49.000 --> 15:51.000
we have spread it in 100 words

15:51.000 --> 15:53.000
then we have defined some values

15:53.000 --> 15:55.000
and prompts of models

15:55.000 --> 15:57.000
after this we have sent

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
the request here

15:59.000 --> 16:01.000
then whatever the request is

16:01.000 --> 16:03.000
we will get its data

16:03.000 --> 16:05.000
so we have logged it

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
now we will do one thing

16:07.000 --> 16:09.000
first we will go to our browser

16:09.000 --> 16:11.000
first we will go from here

16:11.000 --> 16:13.000
and refresh it

16:13.000 --> 16:15.000
now we will

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
go to our wikipedia page

16:17.000 --> 16:19.000
and go to extension

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
then we will click on

16:21.000 --> 16:23.000
the word

16:23.000 --> 16:25.000
as soon as we clicked

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
we will go to

16:27.000 --> 16:29.000
console and see

16:29.000 --> 16:31.000
here it is written promise

16:31.000 --> 16:33.000
you will open this object

16:33.000 --> 16:35.000
then you will see

16:35.000 --> 16:37.000
here

16:37.000 --> 16:39.000
you will go to choices

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
you will see in choices

16:41.000 --> 16:43.000
you will click on 0

16:43.000 --> 16:45.000
and here is a message

16:45.000 --> 16:47.000
you will click on message

16:47.000 --> 16:49.000
so after doing all this

16:49.000 --> 16:51.000
you will get this content

16:51.000 --> 16:53.000
this is a navigation prompt

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
that instructs the user to jump to the main content of the web page

16:55.000 --> 16:57.000
this is your complete summarized content

16:57.000 --> 16:59.000
you got it here

16:59.000 --> 17:01.000
so now

17:01.000 --> 17:03.000
you will have to access this message

17:03.000 --> 17:05.000
so what will you do

17:05.000 --> 17:07.000
here

17:07.000 --> 17:09.000
you will go to choices

17:09.000 --> 17:11.000
then the message

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
the message object

17:13.000 --> 17:15.000
basically the key

17:15.000 --> 17:17.000
you will fetch the content from it

17:17.000 --> 17:19.000
so from here you will get the summary of data

17:19.000 --> 17:21.000
so here you will get the summary

17:21.000 --> 17:23.000
now you will use the method

17:23.000 --> 17:25.000
to access this

17:25.000 --> 17:27.000
so first of all you will go to

17:27.000 --> 17:29.000
your code

17:29.000 --> 17:31.000
in your vs code

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
and here the thing we commented out

17:33.000 --> 17:35.000
we will uncomment it

17:35.000 --> 17:37.000
so actually it commented again

17:37.000 --> 17:39.000
I will uncomment it

17:41.000 --> 17:43.000
ok so now we did the same thing

17:43.000 --> 17:45.000
whatever response we got in the response data

17:45.000 --> 17:47.000
we saw in the response

17:47.000 --> 17:49.000
the key named choices

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
the message and content

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
we accessed it

17:53.000 --> 17:55.000
and saved it in the message from response

17:55.000 --> 17:57.000
and here we locked the console

17:57.000 --> 17:59.000
now we will remove it from here

17:59.000 --> 18:01.000
now we have the summary

18:01.000 --> 18:03.000
but we don't want to show the summary in the console

18:03.000 --> 18:05.000
we want to show it in the popup

18:05.000 --> 18:07.000
so for this we will

18:07.000 --> 18:09.000
send the message

18:09.000 --> 18:11.000
means we will send the message in the popup

18:11.000 --> 18:13.000
so for this we will

18:13.000 --> 18:15.000
go to the background

18:15.000 --> 18:17.000
and write

18:17.000 --> 18:19.000
chrome dot

18:19.000 --> 18:21.000
runtime dot

18:21.000 --> 18:23.000
send message

18:23.000 --> 18:25.000
and what we will put in this

18:25.000 --> 18:27.000
we will make an object by

18:27.000 --> 18:29.000
summary

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
so we will name it by summary

18:31.000 --> 18:33.000
and here it will be message from

18:33.000 --> 18:35.000
response

18:35.000 --> 18:37.000
so we will be sending it

18:37.000 --> 18:39.000
with this name

18:39.000 --> 18:41.000
and after this

18:41.000 --> 18:43.000
we will go to our popup

18:43.000 --> 18:45.000
and we will receive it from the popup

18:45.000 --> 18:47.000
so we will go down here

18:47.000 --> 18:49.000
and here we will write chrome dot

18:49.000 --> 18:51.000
runtime dot

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
on message

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
dot

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
add listener

18:57.000 --> 18:59.000
after this

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
whatever message you want to receive

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
you will remember

19:03.000 --> 19:05.000
that you were giving a parameter

19:05.000 --> 19:07.000
and this is an async function

19:07.000 --> 19:09.000
so here we will write async

19:09.000 --> 19:11.000
async

19:11.000 --> 19:13.000
we will put message in this

19:13.000 --> 19:15.000
after this

19:15.000 --> 19:17.000
we will make our

19:17.000 --> 19:19.000
object and

19:19.000 --> 19:21.000
in this we will put a parameter

19:21.000 --> 19:23.000
if message dot

19:23.000 --> 19:25.000
summary

19:25.000 --> 19:27.000
if there is any summary in the message

19:27.000 --> 19:29.000
then here we will do one thing

19:29.000 --> 19:31.000
that we will make a state to set that summary

19:31.000 --> 19:33.000
here we will make a state

19:33.000 --> 19:35.000
const summary

19:35.000 --> 19:37.000
and then in this we will set

19:37.000 --> 19:39.000
summary

19:39.000 --> 19:41.000
we will put a set parameter

19:41.000 --> 19:43.000
and this is a use state

19:43.000 --> 19:45.000
and in this

19:45.000 --> 19:47.000
empty string

19:47.000 --> 19:49.000
basically here

19:49.000 --> 19:51.000
we took our summary from the background

19:51.000 --> 19:53.000
here we

19:53.000 --> 19:55.000
brought it from runtime dot on message

19:55.000 --> 19:57.000
and after this we will set it

19:57.000 --> 19:59.000
in our summary name

19:59.000 --> 20:01.000
state

20:01.000 --> 20:03.000
so we will do set summary

20:03.000 --> 20:05.000
and here message dot

20:05.000 --> 20:07.000
after doing summary

20:07.000 --> 20:09.000
after doing summary we will set it

20:09.000 --> 20:11.000
so here finally

20:11.000 --> 20:13.000
it is set and after this

20:13.000 --> 20:15.000
what we will do is

20:15.000 --> 20:17.000
as it happens here we will put it in console dot log

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
we will make it

20:19.000 --> 20:21.000
console dot log

20:21.000 --> 20:23.000
and summary

20:23.000 --> 20:25.000
so finally

20:25.000 --> 20:27.000
here we have received

20:27.000 --> 20:29.000
our

20:29.000 --> 20:31.000
summary we have received

20:31.000 --> 20:33.000
here

20:33.000 --> 20:35.000
so in this part we have seen

20:35.000 --> 20:37.000
how we called api

20:37.000 --> 20:39.000
and after this we have brought the message

20:39.000 --> 20:41.000
from there in the popup

20:41.000 --> 20:43.000
and here we have

20:43.000 --> 20:45.000
locked the summary in the console

20:45.000 --> 20:47.000
and set it in state

20:47.000 --> 20:49.000
so now after this we will do one more thing

20:49.000 --> 20:51.000
that in our background file

20:51.000 --> 20:53.000
we will go once and here at the top

20:53.000 --> 20:55.000
you will see that the string dot split

20:55.000 --> 20:57.000
in this you have to add a space

20:57.000 --> 20:59.000
here in the middle

20:59.000 --> 21:01.000
what we did now we did not add space

21:01.000 --> 21:03.000
because of which what happened

21:03.000 --> 21:05.000
that actually the word that it is extracting

21:05.000 --> 21:07.000
the scraped text

21:07.000 --> 21:09.000
it is getting split but

21:09.000 --> 21:11.000
it is getting split letter by letter

21:11.000 --> 21:13.000
means one letter is getting split

21:13.000 --> 21:15.000
now when you will think that one letter is getting split

21:15.000 --> 21:17.000
then how fast the hundred words are getting split

21:17.000 --> 21:19.000
it will complete

21:19.000 --> 21:21.000
for example here we have a sentence

21:21.000 --> 21:23.000
the quick

21:23.000 --> 21:25.000
sentence is not there

21:25.000 --> 21:27.000
so I will call it a small line

21:27.000 --> 21:29.000
brown fox

21:29.000 --> 21:31.000
so here when we did not add space

21:31.000 --> 21:33.000
then by default what it will do

21:33.000 --> 21:35.000
it will separate every word one by one

21:35.000 --> 21:37.000
means it will separate t

21:37.000 --> 21:39.000
it will split h separately

21:39.000 --> 21:41.000
and it will split q separately

21:41.000 --> 21:43.000
like this till here everything will be split separately

21:43.000 --> 21:45.000
so what will happen here

21:45.000 --> 21:47.000
whatever will be sent to our openai

21:47.000 --> 21:49.000
it will be split letter by letter

21:49.000 --> 21:51.000
and because of this

21:51.000 --> 21:53.000
the limit of hundred words that we have set

21:53.000 --> 21:55.000
that till hundred words

21:55.000 --> 21:57.000
minify it

21:57.000 --> 21:59.000
keep only hundred words

21:59.000 --> 22:01.000
so these hundred words will be completed like this

22:01.000 --> 22:03.000
because the spaces here

22:03.000 --> 22:05.000
will take their place

22:05.000 --> 22:07.000
so it is important to give space here

22:07.000 --> 22:09.000
so that the split here

22:09.000 --> 22:11.000
is split word by word

22:11.000 --> 22:13.000
means the quick is here

22:13.000 --> 22:15.000
so that it is split letter by letter

22:15.000 --> 22:17.000
one word will be split

22:17.000 --> 22:19.000
so you must be understanding

22:19.000 --> 22:21.000
so because of this the word

22:21.000 --> 22:23.000
will be more

22:23.000 --> 22:25.000
the hundred words will be

22:25.000 --> 22:27.000
more to summarize

22:27.000 --> 22:29.000
so that the summary

22:29.000 --> 22:31.000
will be more correct

22:31.000 --> 22:33.000
so here we have done this

22:33.000 --> 22:35.000
now we will save it

22:35.000 --> 22:37.000
after this we will go to popup

22:37.000 --> 22:39.000
we have done console.log summary

22:39.000 --> 22:41.000
for now we will remove it

22:41.000 --> 22:43.000
and this is an asynchronous function

22:43.000 --> 22:45.000
you know that

22:45.000 --> 22:47.000
after this we will do one more thing

22:47.000 --> 22:49.000
we will put an if statement

22:49.000 --> 22:51.000
in which we will write if summary.length

22:51.000 --> 22:53.000
and what was our summary

22:53.000 --> 22:55.000
the summary that we have set

22:55.000 --> 22:57.000
if the summary.length is greater than 0

22:57.000 --> 22:59.000
means if the summary is there

22:59.000 --> 23:01.000
then you can

23:01.000 --> 23:03.000
log the summary

23:03.000 --> 23:05.000
so here the summary

23:05.000 --> 23:07.000
will be logged

23:07.000 --> 23:09.000
we have done this much

23:09.000 --> 23:11.000
what we have changed here

23:11.000 --> 23:13.000
we have put space in the middle

23:13.000 --> 23:15.000
because of which

23:15.000 --> 23:17.000
if we had not put space

23:17.000 --> 23:19.000
then by default it would have split

23:19.000 --> 23:21.000
so that the space would be more

23:21.000 --> 23:23.000
and there would not be enough content

23:23.000 --> 23:25.000
to summarize

23:25.000 --> 23:27.000
so here we have come to popup.tsx

23:27.000 --> 23:29.000
and we have seen that

23:29.000 --> 23:31.000
if the summary actually exists

23:31.000 --> 23:33.000
then it will be shown in the console

23:33.000 --> 23:35.000
now what we will do

23:35.000 --> 23:37.000
after this we will go to our web page

23:37.000 --> 23:39.000
and we will open our extension

23:39.000 --> 23:41.000
and we will click in hello world

23:41.000 --> 23:43.000
as soon as we click in hello world

23:43.000 --> 23:45.000
before this we will go

23:45.000 --> 23:47.000
we will refresh our extension

23:47.000 --> 23:49.000
which is very important

23:49.000 --> 23:51.000
we have refreshed our extension

23:51.000 --> 23:53.000
we have gone back

23:53.000 --> 23:55.000
after this we have clicked in hello world

23:55.000 --> 23:57.000
we have gone to console

23:57.000 --> 23:59.000
and here you can see

23:59.000 --> 24:01.000
that our summarization content

24:01.000 --> 24:03.000
has come

24:03.000 --> 24:05.000
it takes some time

24:05.000 --> 24:07.000
because it takes some time to request

24:07.000 --> 24:09.000
the article discusses various goals

24:09.000 --> 24:11.000
in the field of artificial intelligence

24:11.000 --> 24:13.000
including reasoning and problem solving

24:13.000 --> 24:15.000
knowledge representation

24:15.000 --> 24:17.000
it is giving a very precise summary

24:17.000 --> 24:19.000
to you
