WEBVTT

00:06.000 --> 00:21.000
So now we will see how to make a movie carousel, how to make a carousel, then it will be shown on the side, we are going to make the same carousel, so what we will do is go to the source folder first of all and in this we will make a movie carousel and make a component here,

00:21.000 --> 00:45.000
here you have to create a file and here you have to write movie carousel.jsx, as soon as you go into it, as soon as you make a component, you will write rfc in it, the basic body will be the structure, before that there is one more thing, there are many things in our source folder that we do not need, like this app test.js,

00:45.000 --> 00:51.000
after this index.css and after this logo.srg, reward web by tilt, these are some things that we do not need,

00:51.000 --> 01:00.000
then we delete this, like we delete this first and second, first, after that we do not need the logo.svc, we delete this,

01:01.000 --> 01:11.000
then here we do not need the report web by tilt, we delete this and this step setup test.js we do not need it, so we delete this as well,

01:12.000 --> 01:20.000
after this, go to index.js and like they are report web by tils, all this is removed, we did not need them, these are a few things that we do not need,

01:21.000 --> 01:26.000
Now let's save it and check our terminal to see if there is any error.

01:26.000 --> 01:31.000
There is no error. Now we will go to our Movie Crousel.

01:31.000 --> 01:36.000
Now here we start doing our main Movie Crousel code.

01:36.000 --> 01:41.000
So before that, one more thing which is Movie Crousel. Movie Crousel

01:41.000 --> 01:46.000
is basically a library which we will use in our Crousel.

01:46.000 --> 01:51.000
We will have to install its React library. Basically,

01:51.000 --> 01:56.000
we call it a module. So what is a module? Someone has already done that code.

01:56.000 --> 02:01.000
Someone has already made the Crousel. We will install it and use it for ourselves.

02:01.000 --> 02:06.000
Okay. So what happens is that it looks very beautiful.

02:06.000 --> 02:11.000
You don't have to reinvent everything and you can use it quickly and efficiently

02:11.000 --> 02:16.000
and add your logic to it. So now what will you do? You will go to your terminal

02:16.000 --> 02:21.000
and open a new one. And here

02:21.000 --> 02:26.000
what will you do? First of all, I will go back to my project. So my project

02:26.000 --> 02:31.000
is inside this. And

02:31.000 --> 02:36.000
here I am in my project.

02:36.000 --> 02:41.000
You can directly use the terminal here. Let me show you. This terminal here

02:41.000 --> 02:46.000
you can use this terminal below.

02:46.000 --> 02:51.000
I am not using it so that you get a good experience

02:51.000 --> 02:55.000
so that you can see the code that I am writing. So that is why I am doing all these things

02:55.000 --> 02:58.000
separately in the command prompt. But you can install it here as well.

02:58.000 --> 03:03.000
And for that, the command is npm i react-crousel-manual.

03:03.000 --> 03:06.000
So you have to install this library. You will hit enter.

03:06.000 --> 03:11.000
So it will be installed. So now I have installed it in the terminal and shown it to you.

03:11.000 --> 03:15.000
So till the time it is being installed, we will remove the extra we have opened.

03:16.000 --> 03:21.000
And let it run in the background. So this install

03:21.000 --> 03:26.000
has been done. So it has been installed.

03:26.000 --> 03:31.000
Now we will clear it. Now we will remove it.

03:31.000 --> 03:36.000
So now you will have to import it in your code. So you will import it like this.

03:36.000 --> 03:41.000
import brackets-crousel

03:41.000 --> 03:46.000
from react-crousel-manual. So see this has come automatically.

03:46.000 --> 03:51.000
Now after this, after this there are some things which is the

03:51.000 --> 03:56.000
crousel. In that crousel, you were also seeing images. Those images

03:56.000 --> 04:01.000
you have to basically show those images here in the crousel. What you have to do is

04:01.000 --> 04:06.000
that you have to make an array of images. You have to make a container. So that array, that container

04:06.000 --> 04:11.000
in which the image will have a link. You have given the code of that in the code section.

04:11.000 --> 04:16.000
Copy it from there and paste it directly here. Because there are many links in it. So we have to manually

04:16.000 --> 04:21.000
type it. So our time will be wasted. We don't want to do that. And after this, what you have to do is

04:21.000 --> 04:26.000
as soon as you have done your link, now you have to go here in div. And after this, you have to

04:26.000 --> 04:31.000
bring the component of the crousel here. The component of the crousel you have to bring here.

04:31.000 --> 04:36.000
For this, you will do something like this. First, we set this file in JSX

04:36.000 --> 04:41.000
as we did. And done. So we have to render the component of the crousel here.

04:41.000 --> 04:46.000
And now we have to put some properties in it. We have to put some attributes in it.

04:46.000 --> 04:51.000
The first thing is the data. What will we show in this data?

04:51.000 --> 04:56.000
In this, we will pass the data that will be used to show the images.

04:56.000 --> 05:01.000
So the data is basically this. This is the whole

05:01.000 --> 05:06.000
array. The data of the image is complete in it. So we passed this in the data.

05:06.000 --> 05:11.000
Right? After this, the second thing we have to do is we have to put the time in it.

05:11.000 --> 05:16.000
Basically, after how much time delay the images will show us. So we have put 2000 here.

05:16.000 --> 05:21.000
That means the images will come after 2 seconds delay. After this, we have to put the width.

05:21.000 --> 05:26.000
In width, we will put how much width the images should have.

05:26.000 --> 05:31.000
Or how much width the crousel should have. So we have defined here 9000 pixels

05:31.000 --> 05:36.000
or something. Then we have to put the height here. So we have defined the height as well.

05:36.000 --> 05:41.000
The height will be 500 pixels.

05:41.000 --> 05:46.000
After this, we will put the slide number here. Do you have to show the slide number or not?

05:46.000 --> 05:51.000
Should the slide number be visible or not? So after every slide, the slide number is

05:51.000 --> 05:54.000
being shown by doing 1, 2, 3. So we say that we don't want to show the slide number.

05:54.000 --> 05:59.000
After this, should it slide automatically or should it slide when the user clicks?

05:59.000 --> 06:04.000
So we are saying that it should slide automatically. So we set it to true.

06:04.000 --> 06:09.000
Right? After this, we have to show the dots that come down here. You must have noticed

06:09.000 --> 06:14.000
the dots that come when the image slides. You have to show those dots as well.

06:14.000 --> 06:19.000
So for that too, set the dots to true. After this, there are some other

06:19.000 --> 06:24.000
properties of this type. You can put those properties one by one here.

06:24.000 --> 06:29.000
For example, what should be the color of the pause icon? So the color of the pause icon

06:29.000 --> 06:34.000
should be white. The pause icon should be white.

06:34.000 --> 06:39.000
After this, what should be the size of the pause icon?

06:39.000 --> 06:44.000
So we said that the size of the pause icon is around 40 pixels.

06:44.000 --> 06:49.000
So in this way, there are some other properties that you will find in the code section

06:49.000 --> 06:54.000
again. You can directly pick them up from there and you can simply copy and paste here.

06:54.000 --> 06:59.000
So I am doing it here as well. Apart from these properties,

06:59.000 --> 07:04.000
the slide background color, the background color of the slide will be dark gray.

07:04.000 --> 07:09.000
How will the image fit? Should the image fit or not? So you put the image fit

07:09.000 --> 07:13.000
cover here so that the image covers the entire carousel.

07:13.000 --> 07:18.000
Thumbnails means the images that you saw below should come.

07:18.000 --> 07:23.000
And then give it a style that the text should be aligned in the center, the max width should be

07:23.000 --> 07:28.000
this much. So you have put these few things. Now what do we do after this?

07:28.000 --> 07:33.000
Let's save it and once we check how our carousel is looking.

07:33.000 --> 07:38.000
So let's save it once. Now we have made the carousel.

07:38.000 --> 07:43.000
After this, we will have to import this carousel into app.js as well. Because our main app is here. It is here.

07:43.000 --> 07:48.000
Everything will be visible here. So first we will have to import the carousel. So what we will do here is

07:48.000 --> 07:53.000
import the movie carousel that we have made. And this movie carousel

07:53.000 --> 07:58.000
where do we want to show it? We want to show the movie carousel at the top. Where?

07:58.000 --> 08:03.000
We want to show it before the search. So here we do the movie carousel

08:03.000 --> 08:08.000
here. Movie carousel

08:08.000 --> 08:13.000
and I will have to set JSX here again. Ok.

08:13.000 --> 08:18.000
Movie carousel. And now our movie carousel will be visible here.

08:18.000 --> 08:23.000
Now what do we do? Once we open our web page and see if

08:23.000 --> 08:28.000
we can see the movie carousel. So see our movie carousel is visible.

08:28.000 --> 08:33.000
See this. You can see that the whole movie carousel is visible.

08:33.000 --> 08:38.000
And it looks so good to see. So how quickly did you make a carousel?

08:38.000 --> 08:43.000
If you had gone to code this carousel, it would have taken you a lot of time. But as soon as you used that module, your carousel became very fast.

08:43.000 --> 08:48.000
So how interactive is this? You can do it from here to there. There are also some thumbnails

08:48.000 --> 08:53.000
below. Here are some thumbnails. This is called search. So here we search something again.

08:53.000 --> 08:58.000
Here we search for example Sinchan

08:58.000 --> 09:03.000
or something like that. So let's search Sinchan here once.

09:03.000 --> 09:08.000
So here I might have put some wrong spelling. I really don't remember the spelling. So let's do

09:08.000 --> 09:11.000
Batman here.

09:11.000 --> 09:16.000
And look at this. Batman's movies have come here.

09:16.000 --> 09:21.000
And the carousel has come all the way up. So here we learned

09:21.000 --> 09:26.000
how to put a carousel.
