WEBVTT

00:06.000 --> 00:11.000
So now our form has been created, but where will we save the data of that form?

00:11.000 --> 00:16.000
Now some of you must be thinking that why don't we save that data in local storage?

00:16.000 --> 00:23.000
So we can't save data in local storage because local storage is only for one individual.

00:23.000 --> 00:28.000
That means if data is being saved in your computer, then only you will see it, the other person will not be able to see it.

00:28.000 --> 00:35.000
So we can't save the data of the portfolio in the computer of the same user who has created the form.

00:35.000 --> 00:41.000
Then he will be able to see the side of his portfolio and no one else will be able to see it because that data will not be shared with others.

00:41.000 --> 00:47.000
The login data that we had stored was only for that particular user.

00:47.000 --> 00:50.000
So we didn't have any problem with it, we didn't even have to share it.

00:50.000 --> 00:57.000
So now we need something that saves the data of the user in a cloud, in a server, in a storage.

00:57.000 --> 00:58.000
And we can save it.

00:58.000 --> 01:02.000
And when any other user wants, then he will also be able to see that data.

01:02.000 --> 01:06.000
Because the portfolio site will not be seen by just one person.

01:06.000 --> 01:09.000
There are a lot of people who will see the portfolio site.

01:09.000 --> 01:15.000
So we will have to store that data in a place that is accessible from everywhere.

01:15.000 --> 01:18.000
So for this we will use Sanity.

01:18.000 --> 01:19.000
What is Sanity?

01:19.000 --> 01:23.000
You can understand Sanity as a content management platform.

01:23.000 --> 01:27.000
What is a content management platform?

01:27.000 --> 01:30.000
Basically, whatever data you have, everything is handled by Sanity.

01:30.000 --> 01:32.000
You give all your data to Sanity.

01:32.000 --> 01:36.000
And then you get it from Sanity one by one, delete it, do whatever you have to do.

01:36.000 --> 01:40.000
You can run all the CRUD operations on the entire data.

01:40.000 --> 01:45.000
CRUD means you can create any data, basically a document.

01:45.000 --> 01:49.000
You can create any data, you can read it, you can update it, you can delete it.

01:49.000 --> 01:51.000
So you can do all these operations in it.

01:51.000 --> 01:56.000
So basically you can see how many companies have used Sanity.

01:56.000 --> 01:59.000
And this is the latest technology.

01:59.000 --> 02:06.000
All the big companies like Puma, Nike, Figma, Shopify, Loom, Cloudflare.

02:06.000 --> 02:09.000
So all these big companies must be using Sanity.

02:09.000 --> 02:11.000
Who are they actually using?

02:11.000 --> 02:12.000
Sanity.

02:12.000 --> 02:16.000
So it is written here, it is told how it works.

02:16.000 --> 02:22.000
So basically the data that we send, receive, and delete here is all through API calls.

02:22.000 --> 02:24.000
So I will explain everything to you now.

02:24.000 --> 02:26.000
Before that, what we have to do is,

02:26.000 --> 02:28.000
we have to create an account.

02:28.000 --> 02:30.000
For that we click on get started.

02:30.000 --> 02:33.000
And after that we have to sign up here.

02:33.000 --> 02:35.000
So you can sign up here.

02:35.000 --> 02:37.000
So I sign up with my account.

02:37.000 --> 02:39.000
And you also sign up.

02:39.000 --> 02:47.000
And here, after this, our dashboard will open.

02:47.000 --> 02:49.000
What we have to do first is,

02:49.000 --> 02:52.000
now we have to go to create a new project.

02:52.000 --> 02:55.000
And here, the first thing we have to do is,

02:56.000 --> 02:59.000
right now we come back from here.

02:59.000 --> 03:03.000
And we go to our VS Core.

03:03.000 --> 03:05.000
So we have come to our VS Core.

03:05.000 --> 03:09.000
Now, after this, we open our terminal.

03:09.000 --> 03:16.000
And here we go to the directory of Portfolio Builder.

03:16.000 --> 03:18.000
Portfolio Builder.

03:18.000 --> 03:21.000
Okay, I have come to the directory of my current project.

03:21.000 --> 03:24.000
You also have to come to the directory of this project.

03:24.000 --> 03:25.000
After this,

03:25.000 --> 03:27.000
here you will use a command.

03:27.000 --> 03:28.000
Which is,

03:28.000 --> 03:33.000
npm install sanity.

03:33.000 --> 03:35.000
At the rate sanity.

03:35.000 --> 03:38.000
Slash client.

03:38.000 --> 03:39.000
What does this do?

03:39.000 --> 03:41.000
This command basically,

03:41.000 --> 03:43.000
which is your sanity client.

03:43.000 --> 03:44.000
Right?

03:44.000 --> 03:45.000
It installs it.

03:45.000 --> 03:48.000
So there are some dependencies that are required.

03:48.000 --> 03:50.000
So it does this thing for you.

03:50.000 --> 03:53.000
So till it is happening.

03:53.000 --> 03:58.000
Okay, so our sanity is installed.

03:58.000 --> 04:03.000
Now after this, we have to install one more package.

04:03.000 --> 04:05.000
Which is this.

04:05.000 --> 04:08.000
So here I will do it properly.

04:08.000 --> 04:11.000
Okay, npm install at the rate sanity.

04:11.000 --> 04:13.000
Slash block content to react.

04:13.000 --> 04:17.000
And you will install it.

04:17.000 --> 04:18.000
Okay.

04:18.000 --> 04:21.000
So the installation here is complete.

04:21.000 --> 04:22.000
Nice.

04:22.000 --> 04:23.000
Now we will clear it.

04:23.000 --> 04:25.000
And here you have to write after this,

04:25.000 --> 04:28.000
sanity logout.

04:28.000 --> 04:30.000
What does this do?

04:30.000 --> 04:33.000
Basically, you have to give a fresh start.

04:33.000 --> 04:35.000
So you log out sanity.

04:35.000 --> 04:36.000
After this, you write here,

04:36.000 --> 04:38.000
sanity init.

04:38.000 --> 04:40.000
And enter.

04:40.000 --> 04:42.000
As soon as you enter.

04:42.000 --> 04:47.000
So here we ask you some options.

04:47.000 --> 04:50.000
And here you can start creating the back end of sanity.

04:50.000 --> 04:51.000
So here I will press yes.

04:51.000 --> 04:53.000
I will enter.

04:53.000 --> 04:56.000
Now it is asking how you want to login.

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
What will be your login type?

04:58.000 --> 05:01.000
Google, github, email or something else.

05:01.000 --> 05:04.000
So here I will adjust it from a minute.

05:04.000 --> 05:05.000
Okay.

05:05.000 --> 05:07.000
So here I will login with google.

05:07.000 --> 05:09.000
You can select it with up arrow or down arrow.

05:09.000 --> 05:11.000
So now we will login with google.

05:11.000 --> 05:12.000
And enter.

05:12.000 --> 05:17.000
As soon as we enter, it redirects us to the web page.

05:17.000 --> 05:19.000
We are redirected to the web page.

05:19.000 --> 05:23.000
We will click on techie reconnaissance.

05:23.000 --> 05:26.000
And we will login.

05:26.000 --> 05:27.000
Okay, nice.

05:27.000 --> 05:29.000
Login has been successful.

05:29.000 --> 05:32.000
We will go back to our terminal.

05:32.000 --> 05:35.000
And here you are asking us.

05:35.000 --> 05:36.000
Create new project.

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
The project you want to create.

05:38.000 --> 05:40.000
New project.

05:40.000 --> 05:42.000
So you just press enter once.

05:42.000 --> 05:47.000
You press enter from create new project.

05:47.000 --> 05:48.000
In create new project.

05:48.000 --> 05:50.000
And you will press create new project.

05:50.000 --> 05:52.000
It will ask you what you want to name the project.

05:52.000 --> 05:55.000
So you write portfolio.

05:55.000 --> 05:58.000
Underscore backend.

05:58.000 --> 05:59.000
Do backend.

05:59.000 --> 06:05.000
Hit enter.

06:05.000 --> 06:06.000
Okay.

06:06.000 --> 06:08.000
Your content will be stored in a data set.

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
That can be public or private.

06:10.000 --> 06:15.000
Depending whether you want a query or content without authentication.

06:15.000 --> 06:16.000
Okay.

06:16.000 --> 06:17.000
So here you press yes and continue.

06:17.000 --> 06:24.000
By pressing yes.

06:24.000 --> 06:25.000
After this.

06:25.000 --> 06:27.000
After this path will ask you.

06:27.000 --> 06:29.000
Do you want to keep it in this path.

06:29.000 --> 06:31.000
Do you want to keep it in this folder.

06:31.000 --> 06:33.000
Which is the folder of portfolio builder.

06:33.000 --> 06:35.000
You press enter.

06:35.000 --> 06:36.000
And after this it will ask you.

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
You have to select the template.

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
So suppose tomorrow you will create an e-commerce site.

06:40.000 --> 06:41.000
Or a blog site.

06:41.000 --> 06:43.000
Or a movie project site.

06:43.000 --> 06:46.000
So for this you already have the schemas.

06:46.000 --> 06:47.000
Schemas means.

06:47.000 --> 06:48.000
Tables.

06:48.000 --> 06:49.000
Fields.

06:49.000 --> 06:50.000
All these things are already given to you.

06:50.000 --> 06:51.000
Right.

06:51.000 --> 06:52.000
So fields etc.

06:52.000 --> 06:53.000
Are already made.

06:53.000 --> 06:54.000
But we are making a clean project here.

06:54.000 --> 06:55.000
So you will write.

06:55.000 --> 06:57.000
Clean project with no predefined schemas.

06:57.000 --> 06:58.000
So down arrow.

06:58.000 --> 06:59.000
You will bring it here.

06:59.000 --> 07:00.000
And hit enter.

07:00.000 --> 07:01.000
After this it will ask you.

07:01.000 --> 07:02.000
Do you want to use typescript.

07:02.000 --> 07:03.000
So now again we press no.

07:03.000 --> 07:04.000
And.

07:04.000 --> 07:05.000
And.

07:05.000 --> 07:06.000
And.

07:06.000 --> 07:07.000
And.

07:07.000 --> 07:08.000
And.

07:08.000 --> 07:09.000
And.

07:09.000 --> 07:10.000
And.

07:10.000 --> 07:11.000
And.

07:11.000 --> 07:12.000
And.

07:12.000 --> 07:13.000
And.

07:13.000 --> 07:14.000
And.

07:14.000 --> 07:15.000
And.

07:15.000 --> 07:16.000
And.

07:16.000 --> 07:17.000
And.

07:17.000 --> 07:18.000
And.

07:18.000 --> 07:19.000
And.

07:19.000 --> 07:20.000
And.

07:20.000 --> 07:21.000
And.

07:21.000 --> 07:22.000
And.

07:22.000 --> 07:23.000
And.

07:23.000 --> 07:24.000
And.

07:24.000 --> 07:25.000
And.

07:25.000 --> 07:26.000
And.

07:26.000 --> 07:27.000
And.

07:27.000 --> 07:28.000
And.

07:28.000 --> 07:29.000
And.

07:29.000 --> 07:30.000
And.

07:30.000 --> 07:31.000
And.

07:31.000 --> 07:32.000
And.

07:32.000 --> 07:33.000
And.

07:33.000 --> 07:34.000
And.

07:34.000 --> 07:35.000
And.

07:35.000 --> 07:36.000
And.

07:36.000 --> 07:37.000
And.

07:37.000 --> 07:38.000
And.

07:38.000 --> 07:39.000
And.

07:39.000 --> 07:40.000
And.

07:40.000 --> 07:41.000
And.

07:41.000 --> 07:42.000
And.

07:42.000 --> 07:43.000
And.

07:43.000 --> 07:44.000
And.

07:44.000 --> 07:46.000
the file would have been created, if you will see

07:46.000 --> 07:48.000
by doing Portfolio backend

07:48.000 --> 07:50.000
here, by doing Portfolio backend

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
the file is basically a Sanity file

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
in this, all our

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
documents, schemas,

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
all the data, we will send through them

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
in Sanity

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
and here we will define

08:02.000 --> 08:04.000
what will happen in our Sanity data set

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
you will get to know all those things

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
so for now, our Portfolio backend

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
folder, in this, all the configuration

08:10.000 --> 08:12.000
files of Sanity, you will get

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
to know all those things

08:14.000 --> 08:16.000
so now what you have to do first

08:16.000 --> 08:18.000
you have to go to the terminal

08:18.000 --> 08:20.000
and after going here, you have to enter

08:20.000 --> 08:22.000
cd portfolio backend

08:22.000 --> 08:24.000
and you have to write in Sanity

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
dev

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
and as soon as you do Sanity dev

08:28.000 --> 08:30.000
then your

08:30.000 --> 08:32.000
Sanity server will basically

08:32.000 --> 08:34.000
start and here you will get to see

08:34.000 --> 08:36.000
what all things you will store

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
in Sanity

08:38.000 --> 08:40.000
you will get to see everything

08:40.000 --> 08:42.000
so you click on it

08:42.000 --> 08:44.000
and yes, here

08:44.000 --> 08:46.000
the Sanity studio is opening

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
so for now

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
I will remove all these things

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
ok, we don't need that

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
ok, Sanity studio

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
is open

08:56.000 --> 08:58.000
now we have to log in

08:58.000 --> 09:00.000
the thing we logged in

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
we logged in from google, so we will log in from google

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
after this

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
you will see that

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
our Sanity studio is open

09:10.000 --> 09:12.000
here whatever we have created

09:12.000 --> 09:14.000
we have not created yet

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
so you will not see anything here

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
but as soon as we

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
will create different documents

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
fields and different data

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
to store

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
so you will start seeing all those things

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
the data we will store

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
you will start seeing all that

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
so now we will see how we can

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
bring documents and other data

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
and can retrieve it

09:36.000 --> 09:38.000
so you will see all these things now
