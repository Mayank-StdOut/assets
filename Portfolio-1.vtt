00:06.000 --> 00:12.000
Before building an application, let's know the workflow of the application.

00:12.000 --> 00:17.000
First of all, our page is a login page.

00:17.000 --> 00:20.000
We will login through Gmail.

00:20.000 --> 00:24.000
As soon as the user logs in, he will go to the portfolio form.

00:24.000 --> 00:35.000
In the portfolio form, the details of the user will be asked, that is, the name of the user, about the user, the contact information of the user, the user's experience, and these are some things that we will ask the user.

00:35.000 --> 00:45.000
As soon as the user fills these details, we will create a page and a template, which will be a template of a portfolio page.

00:45.000 --> 00:48.000
In that template, we will show these details.

00:48.000 --> 00:51.000
It is very easy, we will login the user.

00:51.000 --> 00:54.000
After logging in, we will enter his details.

00:54.000 --> 00:56.000
We will store it in our backend.

00:56.000 --> 01:03.000
And then we will show the details of the user in the already created template of the portfolio.

01:03.000 --> 01:06.000
So now what will be the template of the portfolio?

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
There will be a home page.

01:08.000 --> 01:09.000
We will create a home page.

01:09.000 --> 01:11.000
There will be an about page.

01:11.000 --> 01:14.000
And right after that, there will be a contact page.

01:14.000 --> 01:18.000
So these will be some pages that will be in our site.

01:18.000 --> 01:20.000
So you must have understood the workflow.

01:20.000 --> 01:23.000
Now there are some things here that you will have to apply logic on the site.

01:23.000 --> 01:24.000
It is enough.

01:24.000 --> 01:27.000
As per the design, you know that everything is normal.

01:27.000 --> 01:34.000
But logic wise, to make your logic building better, we will also add some good logic in it.

01:34.000 --> 01:36.000
Now what is here?

01:36.000 --> 01:40.000
First of all, I will show you here that how everything will actually look.

01:40.000 --> 01:46.000
This is our first page where we will login the user.

01:46.000 --> 01:48.000
First of all, the user will login here.

01:48.000 --> 01:52.000
As soon as he logins, what should happen after logging in?

01:52.000 --> 01:54.000
A portfolio form should open.

01:54.000 --> 01:56.000
So here goes the portfolio form.

01:56.000 --> 02:03.000
Now in the portfolio form, the user will enter details like first name, last name, about, experience and a lot more.

02:03.000 --> 02:05.000
So if we scroll down, something will come down.

02:05.000 --> 02:06.000
Then at the end, there is a submit button.

02:06.000 --> 02:10.000
As soon as the user clicks the submit button, he will get a link generated.

02:10.000 --> 02:12.000
As soon as he clicks on that link, something like this will come on the page.

02:12.000 --> 02:13.000
So what is here?

02:13.000 --> 02:15.000
The page was already created.

02:15.000 --> 02:19.000
But the user's name and details are showing here.

02:19.000 --> 02:20.000
Like the name of the user is showing here.

02:20.000 --> 02:21.000
Right?

02:21.000 --> 02:22.000
The name of the user is showing here.

02:22.000 --> 02:24.000
The role of the user is showing here.

02:24.000 --> 02:25.000
So what is this?

02:25.000 --> 02:29.000
You have already created a template and you have shown the details from there.

02:29.000 --> 02:33.000
Now after this, the fourth page is an about page.

02:33.000 --> 02:35.000
So the about page is something like this.

02:35.000 --> 02:37.000
The user's name is here in the about page.

02:37.000 --> 02:40.000
Here is the user's about experience.

02:40.000 --> 02:42.000
Here is the user's role and experience.

02:42.000 --> 02:44.000
And here is the user's skill.

02:44.000 --> 02:46.000
So something like this will appear.

02:46.000 --> 02:47.000
Right?

02:47.000 --> 02:49.000
After this, the contact page where the user's email will appear.

02:49.000 --> 02:51.000
So you must be able to understand.

02:51.000 --> 02:53.000
That the details that we have entered from the user.

02:53.000 --> 02:55.000
We are showing them.

02:55.000 --> 02:58.000
Now the special thing about this is that it is made in react.

02:58.000 --> 03:01.000
And pages will not be reloaded in react.

03:01.000 --> 03:05.000
That is, when you go to home, go to about, go to contact.

03:05.000 --> 03:07.000
So the pages will not be reloaded.

03:07.000 --> 03:08.000
The best thing.

03:08.000 --> 03:10.000
So its user experience will be very much enhanced.

03:10.000 --> 03:14.000
And after this, here are some other things.

03:14.000 --> 03:19.000
For example, according to different users, the data should be shown differently.

03:19.000 --> 03:20.000
So how will we do that?

03:20.000 --> 03:23.000
We will see all that while making the project further.

03:23.000 --> 03:25.000
You will get to learn sanity in this.

03:25.000 --> 03:27.000
Sanity is basically a headless CMS.

03:27.000 --> 03:29.000
You will also know what it is.

03:29.000 --> 03:32.000
We will not be using normal CSS for CSS here.

03:32.000 --> 03:33.000
We will be using Tailwind.

03:33.000 --> 03:34.000
So it is a very interesting project.

03:34.000 --> 03:36.000
We will also deploy it at the end.

03:36.000 --> 03:38.000
So this website will be hosted.

03:38.000 --> 03:40.000
So you can also share its link with your friends.
